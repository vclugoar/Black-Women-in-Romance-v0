Many a good woman has had to leave a no-good man, but how many of them took a back-seat to his 600-lb. hog? On her own for the first time, Genevieve Gibbs is ecstatic, even if certain people preferred the doormat version of Ms. Gibbs. Finding someone who appreciates the 'new' her has only just hit Gen's to-do list when T.C. Barbour appears in her life.

A tiny Kansas town is a far cry from his native Oakland, California, but it's just the change T. C. needs. While helping his divorced nephew acclimate to single fatherhood, T. C. lands a gig driving a limo for the most powerful woman in Henry Adams. It's a great way to meet people--and one in particular has already made the job worthwhile. All it takes is a short trip from the airport for Genevieve to snag T.C.'s attention for good.

But it wouldn't be Henry Adams without adding more drama to the mix. When Gen's ex Riley returns with his hog in tow, it sets off a chain of events that can ruin everything--unless the residents pull together once again to save the day.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27064404-stepping-to-a-new-day?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=gVj3OV2ROV&rank=1,0.590967715,16

Jessi Rose Clayton would do anything to keep the family ranch from falling into the wrong hands-even agree to take on a rough-and-tumble outlaw as her protector.

And only if she can get the pesky freelance journalist hell-bent on investigating her for corruption--who just so happens to be one of the sexiest men alive and her best friend's younger brother--off her back. But when Mack suspects that her longtime mentor and the city's current mayor is up to no good, she must convince Ezra Holmes to help her investigate the mayor's office.

Ezra can admit to having had a thing for Mackenna in his younger days, even though she barely knew his name back then. But his past feelings for Mack have nothing to do with why he's so committed to exposing her. He suspects she's used her influence as a public official to cut private deals, and breaking this corruption story would be just the thing to jumpstart his fading career. But what is Ezra supposed to do when he discovers Mack isn't the one who's a crooked politician? There's only one thing he can do: join forces with the woman he's been crazy about for far too long.",https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Holmes-Brothers-Book-ebook/dp/B071Z52RSC/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Farrah+Rochon+Trust+Me&qid=1615951229&s=digital-text&sr=1-3,0.487288594,16

That's why they have to hide - even from each other - that their feelings run much deeper than they should.

When Kenny finally gets the chance to train under Monica, this career-defining opportunity comes with a catch: he has to tell Maya who he is and confess his deception, because the spies need her help to bring down an international arms ring.

In the process, they find that their online connection is even stronger offline. But is it strong enough to keep them alive when they have to walk into the mobster's lair and put on the performance of their lives?

1. Ditch him in Rome.

In the fall of 1888, the tiny hamlet of Ridgeway is gearing up for elections on the local and national level. On the national stage, Grover Cleveland is campaigning for re-election against Benjamin Harrison; locally, two men are vying for the mayor's seat being vacated by the retiring Bernard Ridgeway.

A Woman Ahead of Her Time
Saloon owner Angel May Lane is an unconventional woman in every sense of the word. When she's not tending the bar at the Crazy Eights Saloon, she's caring for her elderly aunt, or out with her friends agitating for women's suffrage. Her activities make her a thorn in the side of some folks, but she's determined to see the day when women and men have equal rights- even if it's only in her own small town. Arrested by the town's deputy sheriff, she finds herself both outraged and intrigued by the man who's taken her into custody.

A Man Anchored in Tradition
Deputy Gregory Simmons isn't interested in politics. His main concern is keeping the peace, and that's become an even more complex job since Sheriff Noah Rogers announced his candidacy for mayor. Angel May and her cohorts are causing a ruckus, so he hauls her in. She turns out to be the most enchanting prisoner he's ever had, and before he can stop himself, he's falling for her. She's as troublesome a woman as they come, but he can't deny the way she makes him feel.

Celina Hart had security, a steady job, a predictable fianc. . .and nothing that was making her truly happy. She gave it all up to gamble on her talent, and found success she'd never imagined as one of New York's hottest painters. But when she returns to her South Carolina hometown to care for her ailing father, she gets an even bigger surprise. That 'bow-legged' neighbor's boy she used to play with has grown up into Darius McRae, a lawyer who gave up the D.C. fast-lane to get back to his roots. Now, Darius' dark-chocolate build and slow, easy smile are proving to be just as tempting as any city lights.

The last thing Darius was looking for was a relationship. He'd been burned by too many women who put finance over romance--including his conniving ex-girlfriend Cortina. But Celina's sense of humor and unpretentious ways are igniting more than his passions. And when Cortina starts stirring up a mess of trouble, Darius will do whatever it takes to show Celina a home-grown love is a dream worth everything.",https://www.amazon.com/Just-Cant-Enough-Cheris-Hodges-ebook/dp/B005JE9576/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Cheris+Hodges+Just+cant+get+enough&qid=1615947081&s=digital-text&sr=1-1,0.676881433,11

agent Erin Montgomery is reluctantly back on the job, posing as the sex-kitten groupie girlfriend of rock star Sean Ledger. She'll be joining his band's tour to try to catch an obsessed, dangerous fan. Tormented by nightmares of her failed last assignment, Erin's not exactly eager to be drawn back into the fray. But once she meets Sean, all rocker, all man and dripping with raw sex appeal, she knows she's right where she belongs.

Sean is reluctant to have someone investigating his crew, but when he meets Erin, his objections fly out the window. The beautiful, hard-bitten agent turns him on like no other woman ever has. Sean's caught glimpses of the fiery passion lurking under Erin's cool front and he's determined to break through her hard exterior and make her his.

But Sean's stalker is still at large and she's made it clear she's willing to stop at nothing-even murder-to get him.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11363317-love-and-protect,0.991209209,4

But a sinister response, with threats against her life, leads her to enlist the help of her very handsome, dear friend Jasper Fitzwilliam, Lord Hartwell.

A father and widower, Jasper is not only tasked with keeping Frederica safe but also with helping his vibrant friend choose a suitable husband. The more he tries to keep the ever-surprising woman alive and find her a good match, the more Jasper realizes he cares for her. The two friends risk their lives for each other, so they should be able to risk their feelings for a chance at a deep and true love together.

On a much-needed ski getaway with her girlfriends, the last person Reyna Allen wants to run into is the lawyer who ruined her life. The tattoo artist's bitter divorce left her with nothing, and she blames her ex-husband's attorney, Garrison Richards. Now firelight dinners, winter walks in the Adirondacks and toe-curling chemistry are daring her to give in to the one man she refuses to ever trust.

Garrison is good at his job--and where Reyna's concerned, he may have been a little too good. He regrets the role he played in her divorce and intends to show Reyna that he's found his moral compass since then. But as their mutual heat thaws her resolve, will doubts put the freeze on their relationship--before he can convince her that they're the ones meant for happily -ever-after?",https://www.amazon.com/Snowy-Mountain-Nights-Kimani-Romance-ebook/dp/B00OYCW2F6/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Lindsay+Evans+Snowy+mountain&qid=1616006824&s=digital-text&sr=1-1,0.546912968,19

I don't do shy women.
And I don't do women that need rescuing.
Then why am I so drawn to her?
Sandra Robinson. Even her name sounds unsullied. She isn't my type. So, when I found myself thinking about her after the one dance we shared at my best friend's wedding, I was confused. Months later, when she was left stranded, I began rearranging the entirety of my schedule to be her chauffeur, I grew suspicious. Of myself.
I've taken care of my family since the age of thirteen. I've spent over a decade building up my real estate business to become one of the most well known in the city of Williamsport. And I dated women who didn't go speechless at a simple request to dance. That isn't who I am. Then why is this woman with eyes the color of maple syrup, and a ten year old daughter who is her mirror image, causing me to spend my days and nights thinking about her? And why am I so ready to put my own personal demons to the side, just to win her heart? Because, make no mistake, that is what I'm after. I don't intend on losing.
But winning this game will require patience to break down the barriers she's erected around her heart. Once they're down, I don't plan on letting up. Anything or anyone that gets in my way is in trouble.

Devin and Ayden were my best friends. We were practically joined at the hip since age two. When we were kids, we thought we were invincible, inseparable, that nothing or no one could come between us.

But we were wrong.

Everything turned to crap our senior year of high school.

Devin was turning into a clone of his deadbeat lowlife father--fighting, getting wasted, and screwing his way through every girl in town. I'd been hiding a secret crush on him for years. Afraid to tell him how I felt in case I ruined everything. So, I kept quiet and slowly watched him self-destruct with a constant ache in my heart.

Where Devin was all brooding darkness, Ayden was the shining light. Our star quarterback with the bright future whom everyone loved. But something wasn't right. He was so guarded, and he wouldn't let me in.

When Devin publicly shamed me, Ayden took my side, and our awesome-threesome bond was severed. The split was devastating. The heartbreak inevitable.

Ayden and I moved on with our lives, but the pain never lessened, and Devin was never far from our thoughts.

Ramsey does his best to condition Gianna before Felicity, owner of Wedded Bliss, presents Gianna with his offer of marriage. Ramsey wants Gianna more than he wants his next million. He can't see himself without her and would do whatever it takes to make sure she's eventually his. But is he moving too fast for a woman who likes to take things slow. She has no experience with relationships. He's hoping to change all that.

Gianna is still confused as to why a man like Ramsey St. Claire has set his sights on her. She doesn't have time to devote to him - no, not when she has Gemma to worry about. Still, she can't help but love the way her stomach flutters whenever Ramsey is within a few feet of her. Whenever their eyes connect. Whenever she sees that brilliant, sexy smile of his. For the first time in her life, she actually likes a man and is experiencing all the tingly, pulse-racing sensations that comes along with it. But is she ready for a permanent attachment to a man she hardly knows?",https://www.amazon.com/Baked-Love-Boardwalk-Bakery-Romance-ebook/dp/B071HNMGX7/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Tina+Martin+Baked+With+Love+2&qid=1616024394&sr=8-1,,
