agent Erin Montgomery is reluctantly back on the job, posing as the sex-kitten groupie girlfriend of rock star Sean Ledger. She'll be joining his band's tour to try to catch an obsessed, dangerous fan. Tormented by nightmares of her failed last assignment, Erin's not exactly eager to be drawn back into the fray. But once she meets Sean, all rocker, all man and dripping with raw sex appeal, she knows she's right where she belongs.

Sean is reluctant to have someone investigating his crew, but when he meets Erin, his objections fly out the window. The beautiful, hard-bitten agent turns him on like no other woman ever has. Sean's caught glimpses of the fiery passion lurking under Erin's cool front and he's determined to break through her hard exterior and make her his.

But Sean's stalker is still at large and she's made it clear she's willing to stop at nothing-even murder-to get him.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11363317-love-and-protect,Adult Romance,1

Or else her father will set her up with one of his friends. The bonbon-loving illegitimate daughter of the duke wants to choose her own husband. Advertising in the newspaper seems like the way to go. But a sinister response, with threats against her life, leads her to enlist the help of her very handsome, dear friend Jasper Fitzwilliam, Lord Hartwell.

A father and widower, Jasper is not only tasked with keeping Frederica safe but also with helping his vibrant friend choose a suitable husband. The more he tries to keep the ever-surprising woman alive and find her a good match, the more Jasper realizes he cares for her. The two friends risk their lives for each other, so they should be able to risk their feelings for a chance at a deep and true love together. But he's not looking for marriage and she's not looking for convenience.",https://www.amazon.com/Butterfly-Bride-Advertisements-Love-Book-ebook/dp/B07DC425XY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Vanessa+Riley+The+Butterfly+Bride&qid=1615957167&sr=8-1,Adult Romance,1

On a much-needed ski getaway with her girlfriends, the last person Reyna Allen wants to run into is the lawyer who ruined her life. The tattoo artist's bitter divorce left her with nothing, and she blames her ex-husband's attorney, Garrison Richards. Now firelight dinners, winter walks in the Adirondacks and toe-curling chemistry are daring her to give in to the one man she refuses to ever trust.

Garrison is good at his job--and where Reyna's concerned, he may have been a little too good. He regrets the role he played in her divorce and intends to show Reyna that he's found his moral compass since then. But as their mutual heat thaws her resolve, will doubts put the freeze on their relationship--before he can convince her that they're the ones meant for happily -ever-after?",https://www.amazon.com/Snowy-Mountain-Nights-Kimani-Romance-ebook/dp/B00OYCW2F6/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Lindsay+Evans+Snowy+mountain&qid=1616006824&s=digital-text&sr=1-1,Adult Romance,1

Gina Morales wants to win. It's her fifth season on The Dance Off, a top-rated network TV celebrity dance competition, and she's never even made it to the finals. When she meets her latest partner, she sees her chance. He's handsome, rippling with muscles, and he stars on the popular Alaskan wilderness reality show Living Wild. With his sexy physique and name recognition, she thinks he's her ticket to the finalsuntil she realizes they're being set up.

Stone Nielson hates Los Angeles, he hates reality TV, and he hates that fact that he had to join the cast of the The Dance Off because of family obligations. He can't wait to get back to Alaska, but he also can't deny his growing attraction to his bubbly Puerto Rican dance partner. Neither of them are looking for romantic entanglements, and Stone can't risk revealing his secrets, but as they heat up the dance floor, it's only a matter of time until he feels an overwhelming urge to take the lead.

When the tabloids catch on to their developing romance, the spotlight threatens to ruin not just their relationship, but their careers and their shot at the trophy. Gina and Stone will have to decide if their priorities lie with fame, fortune, or the chance at a future together.",https://www.amazon.com/Take-Lead-Dance-Off-Novel-ebook/dp/B0746MGC72/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Alexis+Daria+Take+the+Lead&qid=1615941101&s=audible&sr=1-1,Adult Romance,1

I don't do shy women.
And I don't do women that need rescuing.
Then why am I so drawn to her?
Sandra Robinson. Even her name sounds unsullied. She isn't my type. So, when I found myself thinking about her after the one dance we shared at my best friend's wedding, I was confused. Months later, when she was left stranded, I began rearranging the entirety of my schedule to be her chauffeur, I grew suspicious. Of myself.
I've taken care of my family since the age of thirteen. I've spent over a decade building up my real estate business to become one of the most well known in the city of Williamsport. And I dated women who didn't go speechless at a simple request to dance. That isn't who I am. Then why is this woman with eyes the color of maple syrup, and a ten year old daughter who is her mirror image, causing me to spend my days and nights thinking about her? And why am I so ready to put my own personal demons to the side, just to win her heart? Because, make no mistake, that is what I'm after. I don't intend on losing.
But winning this game will require patience to break down the barriers she's erected around her heart. Once they're down, I don't plan on letting up. Anything or anyone that gets in my way is in trouble.
