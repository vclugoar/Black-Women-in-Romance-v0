Yahrah St. John,http://www.yahrahstjohn.com/,"Writing has always been my first love.

My fascination with the craft began when I was twelve years old. While other kids were outside playing, I was inside writing short stories by long hand in one of many spiral notebooks. In those days being raised by a single mother, there was no typewriter or computers handy. I wrote over twenty short stories and plays. I even went as far as creating covers for each book and making all my friends and family sign them out and return them just like a library. Even then, I knew someday I would be in print.

I obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Northwestern University. While in college, I further developed my writing skills through creative writing courses and writing for my college newspaper, The Daily Northwestern.

Life, however, took me along a different path away from my true passion. A chance job at a residential real estate company after graduation led me to my knack for problem solving. I enjoyed three years in the residential field before moving on to commercial property management. A native Chicagoan, I now live in Orlando Florida where I have been working as a Commercial Property Manager for the last decade.

In 2001, my passion for fiction was reawakened at a local conference after a long talk with a fellow author who encouraged me to pursue my dream. The talk along with my long held desire to be published finally led me to complete my first novel, One Magic Moment in 2002. The pessimist in me was terrified of submitting the book to publishers, but my mother, family and friends were immensely supportive.

In March 2003, I attended Romance Slam Jam, a romance writer's conference and pitched my novel during an editor appointment. The editor expressed interest and took my synopsis and three sample chapters with her on the plane. Three days later, I received a call from the editor. She wanted to read the whole book. Needless to say, I was ecstatic and overnighted the novel. Three months later, the editor phoned and although she was leaving the house, told me not to worry. Two weeks later, I received the call from BET Books. The road to publication has been a dream come true for me and turned this one time pessimist into an eternal optimist.

I am now the author of twenty novels. I have been nominated for an Emma Award and have consistently received four-star reviews from Romantic Times BookReviews, RawSistaz Reviewers and Romance in Color. In May 2014, I won the 2013 Best Kimani Romance from RT Book Reviews for A CHANCE WITH YOU."
