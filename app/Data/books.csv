Many a good woman has had to leave a no-good man, but how many of them took a back-seat to his 600-lb. hog? On her own for the first time, Genevieve Gibbs is ecstatic, even if certain people preferred the doormat version of Ms. Gibbs. Finding someone who appreciates the 'new' her has only just hit Gen's to-do list when T.C. Barbour appears in her life.

A tiny Kansas town is a far cry from his native Oakland, California, but it's just the change T. C. needs. While helping his divorced nephew acclimate to single fatherhood, T. C. lands a gig driving a limo for the most powerful woman in Henry Adams. It's a great way to meet people--and one in particular has already made the job worthwhile. All it takes is a short trip from the airport for Genevieve to snag T.C.'s attention for good.

But it wouldn't be Henry Adams without adding more drama to the mix. When Gen's ex Riley returns with his hog in tow, it sets off a chain of events that can ruin everything--unless the residents pull together once again to save the day.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27064404-stepping-to-a-new-day?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=gVj3OV2ROV&rank=1,0.40864405035972595,12.0

Their online relationship is complicated. She's a sex worker and he's her client. He's a spy and she was once his surveillance subject. Technically there are only two degrees of separation between them, but only Kenny knows that. What works online could never work in the real world, right? That's why they have to hide - even from each other - that their feelings run much deeper than they should.

When Kenny finally gets the chance to train under Monica, this career-defining opportunity comes with a catch: he has to tell Maya who he is and confess his deception, because the spies need her help to bring down an international arms ring.

Maya is heartbroken to find out that Kenny has been deceiving her for months. She struggles to reconcile the man she used to fantasize about and the one in front of her. But she agrees to help him for one reason: she needs the money. Or at least that's what she tells herself.

The entire mission hinges on the two being a believable couple in Maya's camroom to lure an Albanian mobster into a trap. In the process, they find that their online connection is even stronger offline. But is it strong enough to keep them alive when they have to walk into the mobster's lair and put on the performance of their lives?

Sometimes she wants to scream, I am a child of Africa! And sometimes she wants to dream about a love that will save her from her loneliness...but mostly she wants to fit in.

Tim Singleton lost his wife to breast cancer less than a year ago and yet the pain and anger is still fresh in his mind.

So Dani asks the universe for the perfect friend-with-benefits--someone who knows the score and knows their way around the bedroom.

When big, brooding security guard Zafir Ansari rescues Dani from a workplace fire drill gone wrong, it's an obvious sign: PhD student Dani and former rugby player Zaf are destined to sleep together. But before she can explain that fact to him, a video of the heroic rescue goes viral. Suddenly, half the internet is shipping #DrRugbae--and Zaf is begging Dani to play along. Turns out his sports charity for kids could really use the publicity. Lying to help children? Who on earth would refuse?

Dani's plan is simple: fake a relationship in public, seduce Zaf behind the scenes. The trouble is, grumpy Zaf is secretly a hopeless romantic--and he's determined to corrupt Dani's stone-cold realism. Before long, he's tackling her fears into the dirt. But the former sports star has issues of his own, and the walls around his heart are as thick as his... um, thighs.

Here's my advice for how to survive a vacation to Italy with the college boyfriend you've just now realized is terrible:

1. Ditch him in Rome.
2. Take the train to Naples for pizza.
3. Let the attractive older man you've just met buy you a drink.
4. Flirt a little (or a lot) while ignoring his wedding ring.
5. Let him bend you over a table.
6. Break up with your boyfriend.

New York City police detective Priscilla Gutierrez has never been afraid to go after what she wants. Second guessing herself isn't a thing she does. But lately, the once-clear vision she had for herself--her career, her relationships, her life--is no longer what she wants.

What she especially doesn't want is to be stuck on a private jet to the Dominican Republic with JuanPa, the one person who knows her better than anyone else.

By the end of a single week in paradise, the love/hate thing JuanPa and Pris have been doing for sixteen years has risen to epic proportions. No one can argue their connection is still there. And they can both finally admit--if only to themselves--they've always been a perfect match. The future they dreamed of together is still within reach...if they can just accept each other as they are.",https://www.amazon.com/American-Sweethearts-Dreamers-Book-4-ebook/dp/B07WHSKR2L/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Adriana+Herrera+American+sweetheart&qid=1615933710&s=books&sr=1-1,0.7920668125152588,15.0

Shanti and her husband may share an immediate and powerful attraction, but her subjects see her as an outsider, and everything she was taught about being the perfect wife goes disastrously wrong.

agent Erin Montgomery is reluctantly back on the job, posing as the sex-kitten groupie girlfriend of rock star Sean Ledger. She'll be joining his band's tour to try to catch an obsessed, dangerous fan. Tormented by nightmares of her failed last assignment, Erin's not exactly eager to be drawn back into the fray. But once she meets Sean, all rocker, all man and dripping with raw sex appeal, she knows she's right where she belongs.

Sean is reluctant to have someone investigating his crew, but when he meets Erin, his objections fly out the window. The beautiful, hard-bitten agent turns him on like no other woman ever has. Sean's caught glimpses of the fiery passion lurking under Erin's cool front and he's determined to break through her hard exterior and make her his.

But Sean's stalker is still at large and she's made it clear she's willing to stop at nothing-even murder-to get him.",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11363317-love-and-protect,0.9210014939308167,4.0

Or else her father will set her up with one of his friends. The bonbon-loving illegitimate daughter of the duke wants to choose her own husband. Advertising in the newspaper seems like the way to go. But a sinister response, with threats against her life, leads her to enlist the help of her very handsome, dear friend Jasper Fitzwilliam, Lord Hartwell.

A father and widower, Jasper is not only tasked with keeping Frederica safe but also with helping his vibrant friend choose a suitable husband. The more he tries to keep the ever-surprising woman alive and find her a good match, the more Jasper realizes he cares for her. The two friends risk their lives for each other, so they should be able to risk their feelings for a chance at a deep and true love together. But he's not looking for marriage and she's not looking for convenience.",https://www.amazon.com/Butterfly-Bride-Advertisements-Love-Book-ebook/dp/B07DC425XY/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Vanessa+Riley+The+Butterfly+Bride&qid=1615957167&sr=8-1,0.9504988789558411,0.0

Hot kisses...

On a much-needed ski getaway with her girlfriends, the last person Reyna Allen wants to run into is the lawyer who ruined her life. The tattoo artist's bitter divorce left her with nothing, and she blames her ex-husband's attorney, Garrison Richards. Now firelight dinners, winter walks in the Adirondacks and toe-curling chemistry are daring her to give in to the one man she refuses to ever trust.

I don't do shy women.
And I don't do women that need rescuing.
Then why am I so drawn to her?
Sandra Robinson. Even her name sounds unsullied. She isn't my type. So, when I found myself thinking about her after the one dance we shared at my best friend's wedding, I was confused. Months later, when she was left stranded, I began rearranging the entirety of my schedule to be her chauffeur, I grew suspicious. Of myself.
I've taken care of my family since the age of thirteen. I've spent over a decade building up my real estate business to become one of the most well known in the city of Williamsport. And I dated women who didn't go speechless at a simple request to dance. That isn't who I am. Then why is this woman with eyes the color of maple syrup, and a ten year old daughter who is her mirror image, causing me to spend my days and nights thinking about her? And why am I so ready to put my own personal demons to the side, just to win her heart? Because, make no mistake, that is what I'm after. I don't intend on losing.
But winning this game will require patience to break down the barriers she's erected around her heart. Once they're down, I don't plan on letting up. Anything or anyone that gets in my way is in trouble.
