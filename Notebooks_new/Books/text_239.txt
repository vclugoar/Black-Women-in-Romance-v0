SYNOPSIS





Jemma Love is beholden to no one, and wants nothing more than to keep it that way. She’s built a lifestyle around the things she enjoys most – traveling, good food, and good… company.

She doesn’t need anything else.

Except… Levi Anders throws a bit of a wrench in those plans. He just might be the perfect compliment to Jemma’s way of life, and he’s definitely not shy about making his intentions clear.

He wants a place in her world, and wants her in his.

Simple, right?

Maybe.

It’s one thing to want something – and something else entirely to accept it.



(I Think I Might Want You is a novella, and the final installment in the Love Sisters series)





Author’s Note





Author’s Note-



Well, isn’t this exciting?!

This is the first time I’ve ever planned, started, and complete a series back to back, and I couldn’t be prouder of doing what I set out to do. For whatever reason, once I started it, my brain wouldn’t let me back out of it – I wish it would employ that kind of imposed discipline when I try to go on a diet, but that’s here nor there – and the Love Sisters are the result of that.

I hope you’ve enjoyed these sisters. The span of time from Jac’s story to Jemma’s is only about six months, so as with most of my work, what we’ve seen here is only the beginning of the healthy relationships I leave them in at the end of the book. They’ll continue their stories off the page, leaving me free to move on to whoever’s beginning is next. 😊



LW, CJ, AC, RJ, DP, RS, thank you so much for lending your eyes and commentary during the beta process of this project, in entirety. LB, NF, AW, PB, for believing I could do this and pushing me toward it, and holding me up when all I wanted to do was lay down. Always, always, thanks to God for the gift of being able to get these people out of my head in a way that makes sense.



And last, but not ever never least, to the readers who support not just my work, but me.



Thank you. <3





One





Jemma



What you need a name for?

Boy you know what I came for.

No identities needed,

Just my exact instructions heeded

Fuck me good, and then you gon’ eat it.

Look me right in the eyes,

Put in work between my thighs…

“Okay now Jemma,” Arizona grinned at me as the music phased out, bringing us back from a short break on the Arnez and Arizona show. “I know you already know what the next question is, don’t you?”

I pressed my lips together to stifle my immediate smile, because yes, of course, I knew what the unspoken question was, and I already had my answer prepared for it. “Y’all know I love you, but… Jemma Love does not kiss and tell.”

Arnez put down his customary teacup and leaned forward. “Oh but you’ve already told it all, except what we all want to know – what is that nigga from chapter five’s name, sis?”

I leaned back in my chair, shaking my head. “I ain’t gone be able to do it,” I said. “All the good parts are already there in the book, in vivid detail, like you said. His name is probably the least interesting thing about him.”

“That dick though…” Arnez said.

“That mouth though,” Arizona chimed, with a little shimmy.

And no lie… I felt that.

Literally.

The memory of my experience with “that nigga from chapter five” was still potent.

It was potent as fuck.

“I didn’t call it the most transformative sexual experience of my life for nothing,” I admitted. The truth was, I didn’t actually know his name, which made it a helluva lot easier to evade the question.

Of course, they didn’t need to know that though.

“Hell, that shit was the most “transformative sexual experience” of my life too sis,” Arizona laughed. “I had to get a stiff drink and a fat blunt after reading that.”

“Had to make myself a damn sandwich too,” Arnez added. “Woke my man up, his old ass talking about he tired, like I ain’t see him eat three chili dogs for dinner. You ain’t tired, you’re bloated and lethargic.”

Arizona laughed. “Oh my God, you sound so mad.”

“I am mad, honey,” Arnez said, scowling. “Back to NoNameBigDick though – you hitting that again or nah?”

I shook my head. “As evidenced in the book, I just like to let the experience be that – no need to try to recreate the same magic twice. We had a great time together, one that elevated my entire trip to Cuba. I meet someone damn near everywhere I go, after I’ve done exploring on my own. It always heightens the whole experience.”

“I got it, so it's like that Mr. Rogers thing, about finding the helpers,” Arizona said. “Only instead of finding the helpers, you find the niggas.”

I cocked a finger at her, nodding. “You’re exactly right.”

“I cannot believe you’re encouraging her nonsense,” Arnez laughed.

Arizona shook her head. “It’s not nonsense – it’s complete sense.”

After that, the rest of the interview went on, talking about other elements of the book. This was something I always enjoyed, even if I did have a little bit of nerves going on at first every time. Getting to talk about my words, about my experiences traveling the world, the lessons I learned the people I met… It was what my whole “brand” was built upon.

No, there wasn't anything particularly new about being a black woman traveling the world. But that didn't make my voice less valuable. There was room for every single one of us. I was – at least according to myself - fun, I was cute, had my own opinions, my own experiences, all of which I’d used to develop this book which seemed to be resonating with people all over the world.

And now, I was here with Arnez and Arizona, living out a dream of being interviewed about something I had created, with a duo I watched religiously for their funny, smart content.

Writing a book was something I hadn't even been able to fathom before Toni suggested it. Her family owned Blakewood’s local bookstore, and she was married into the Wright family as well.

Actually, soon to be married into the family. She and Justin were still in the planning process, but it was coming soon.

She smiled at me as I stepped away from the interview couch after it was over. “That wasn't so bad was it? I mean, of course I know it wasn't bad to you, and you were excited, but… you were a little nervous too.”

“True,” I agreed, “But you're right - not bad at all. They made it fun,” I assured, as we headed back toward the dressing room area. “Not gonna lie, I wish there was less interest in Mr. Chapter Five, but oh well. I knew it was coming.”

Toni grinned. “Good, cause I was about to say… can you blame them?”

No.

I couldn’t.

It would have been silly of me not to expect readers, and interviewers, and even people who hadn't actually read the book, but were following the snippets online, to be keenly over interested in the tale I’d weaved between those pages. Truthfully, there was very little creative liberty taken for that chapter, unlike some of my other encounters which had required little embellishments here and there to make them book worthy.

Ol’ boy from chapter five was worth a whole book on his own.

It was wearing on me more than a little that it had been months now, but I still could not get him off my mind. Sure, I remembered the men whose company I’d enjoyed through the course of my travels — when they gave me something to remember — but I wasn't usually… enamored with them, like I had found myself with… him.

I couldn't get him off my mind.

I thought writing about it would cure me of my lingering interest, but all it had done was keep him close to the forefront of my mind. Which was a key indicator that I needed something else to do.

Maybe someone else to do.

“Okay,” Toni’s assistant said as she bustled up to us. “You ladies have four hours to grab a bite, check out, and get to the airport to make your flight back to Blakewood.”

“Yep,” Toni nodded. “We cannot miss Big Joe’s birthday cookout.”

“It’s at Joseph and Devyn’s, right?” I asked.

“Yes,” Toni confirmed. “Who are you staying with while you're in Blakewood this time?”

“I'm actually at a hotel this time,” I told her. “Since I'll be hanging around for a while. Reesie is gonna pop and have this baby any moment.”

“You’re absolutely right,” Toni agreed. “So, let’s eat, then get on this plane. Wright family duty calls.”





“Jemma Neutron,” Jason greeted, as soon as I walked through the door of Big Joe's cookout. Devyn and Joseph lived in one of those idyllic family neighborhoods with the perfect grass and all that, that kinda creeped me out. But I loved their house, specifically, and I loved them, so I came out whenever I was invited.

And, obviously, I wouldn’t miss my Uncle’s birthday celebration just because it didn’t seem like the dogs over here barked.

“What’s up family?” I laughed at Jason, accepting his hug and then moving on to greet the rest of the family – my siblings and the Wright siblings and all the kids, and the other cousins, and… apparently a large chunk of Blakewood I didn’t actually know.

“Who are all these extra people?” I asked Devyn when I found her at the buffet table that had been set up on their fully decked out back patio. There was food for miles.

“I think a couple of us invited extra people here and there, including Big Joe. I’m pretty sure everyone who has visited the car lot in the last two weeks got invited out to come fix a plate, and these negroes sure as hell did accept the offer.”

I wrinkled my nose at her, patting her shoulder with a teasing grin. “Good thing you guys decided to get the supersize backyard, huh?” I asked.

She huffed. “Girl, if you say so. I hate I offered to host this thing once I saw how many damn people it was. I'm just ready for these damn folks to leave, so the crew I hired to clean all this stuff up can come in and return my house back to normal.”

“Cannot say I blame you,” I said. “But for what it's worth, it looks amazing out here.”

“Thanks cousin,” she said, kissing me on the cheek. “For what it cost, it’d better look good out here. When you recommended the people who did your book launch party, I forgot you were all Big Baller Brand now, with your best-selling novel and all that,” she teased.

“Please,” I waved her off, grinning. “I'm a long way from balling.”

“If you say so,” she said, looking up to gaze across the yard. There were kids all over the place, and bounce-houses and ball pits to accommodate them, in addition to the bar and pool table for the adults. “Oh,” she said. “Joseph must have caught Levi at home for a change. I see he invited him over.”

I followed Devyn's gaze across the yard, peering through the crowd for an unfamiliar face. I'd heard her mention the name Levi before, as one of their neighbors, but I've never met him myself. As I watched, the crowd seemed to part in the middle, and Devyn yelled out to get his attention.

“Levi,” she called. “Come on up here and fix yourself a plate!”

I was still looking, expecting “Levi” to be one of the older men I saw sitting together in a group with Big Joe – one of the ones talking shit and drinking with him at the Spades table.

Nah.

What actually happened was that, a few feet away, a man’s head lifted and turned in response to Devyn’s insistent prompting.

But his face wasn’t unfamiliar at all.

“I gotta go,” I said, more to myself than Devyn, but before I could get anywhere, she grabbed my hand.

“Hold on,” she said. “I really want you to meet him, cause I think he’s single, and I know his ass is fine. This is the artist who did that portrait of me that's in Josie’s room, remember? Joseph’s Christmas gift.”

Those words made my heart race even more than it already was, as “Levi” made his way to where we were standing.

Those words confirmed what I wanted to call my eyes a liar about.

It was him.

Mr. Chapter Five.

There he was, with that delicious butter pecan skin and rugged stubble I vividly remembered as heaven against my thighs. Chiseled jaw. Full, sensual lips, perfectly kissable, perfectly sittable. Broad shoulders and big hands.

Check, check, check, check and so on.

Yeah, it was him.

Those intense brown eyes of his narrowed with recognition as he approached, and his footsteps slowed, but just a bit. Those lips curved just the slightest bit, into a half-smile.

“Levi,” Devyn greeted, warmly. “I want you to meet my cousin Jemma. You’re always out jet-setting, traveling the world,” she said, then gestured toward me. “That’s Jemma’s thing too! I bet the two of you would have a ton to talk about!” She turned fully toward me, so that Levi wouldn't see her wink at me.

She was so pleased with herself.

And I mean, in a typical situation like this, she should be. She was being a good cousin – a solid ass wing-woman, introducing me to a fine ass single man, knowing that fine single men were exactly my type.

What she didn’t know was that Levi and I were already very, very well acquainted.

“She even wrote a book,” Devyn gushed, in slow motion. Or…maybe that was just my brain’s reaction to her sharing that particular tidbit. “About traveling. You should totally read it.”

I finally seemed to remember how my mouth worked, enough to shake my head and step forward, hands up for emphasis and defense.

“No. Uh-uh. Nawl. Nope. Nah... Definitely, definitely should not do that,” I insisted, hoping I didn’t sound as ridiculous as I undoubtedly did. “There’s like a whole chapter on menstruating in third-world countries, and I'm sure he's not interested in reading that,” I said, looking Devyn right in the face, hoping she would take my hint.

“I actually love reading,” he said, in that indistinguishably sexy hybrid accent that had seduced me into bed with him in the first place. His dark gaze was locked on mine, smoldering and unrelenting. “I'll definitely be checking it out. Jemma Wright?”

“No,” Devyn corrected, “Jemma Love, actually. And the book is called Speak, Play, Grub. It’s all about her travels, and the food she ate, the people she met, all that. I don’t remember a whole chapter of period stuff, but it’s enlightening, and good information for anyone. There’s hot sex too.”

“Oh really?” Levi asked, his eyes going a little wider.

“Devyn nodded. “Oh yeah, it’s all people can talk about.” She paused, with a little frown. “Wait, you're not like a prude, are you?” she asked, making Levi laugh.

“No,” he chuckled, the sound forcing my thighs together in a quick squeeze to control my slutty ass hormones. “Not at all.”

No, definitely not.

“Okay good. Whew,” she said, mimicking the motion of wiping sweat from her forehead. “I was ready to brag about being a good saleswoman, unless I talked you out of the sale,” she laughed.

“No,” Levi assured. “I'll definitely be checking it out.”

“Good stuff. Okay, well come on over here and get you something to eat, I know my husband probably snatched you off the street as you were heading inside. You fix yourself a plate okay?”

Instead of moving, his gaze lingered on me, as if he were recommitting my face to memory. Then, he dragged those perfect white teeth over his perfect, velvety smooth bottom lip. “Nice to meet you, Jemma,” he said, his eyes glittering with something I couldn’t recognize. “Thank you, Devyn.”

Holy shit, I muttered to myself as I hurried away, before Devyn could find any new reasons to keep the conversation going. I deftly avoided any of my family members as I snuck into the house, which hadn't been made open to the nearly fifty people milling about the back yard.

Sorry.

But I needed a quiet spot to process the fact that I had just, in the most innocuous way possible, ran into a man I never expected to see again.

And it had been so… quiet.

But I knew from our two-day-two-night stand in Havana that that was part of his charm… part of his danger.

He was so lowkey, so unassumingly sexy, so seemingly harmless that you got sucked into his web of pleasure and forced to cum until you blacked out.

Web of pleasure, Jemma? Really?

Okay.

Maybe I'd been reading too much.

But as ridiculous as my internal phrasing was, it was no exaggeration. Those two days and two nights together with him had knocked me completely off-kilter, and then I woke up on the third and he was simply gone.

Not real anymore, but not a figment of my imagination either.

A fond memory to revisit.

A great, juicy story to tell.

Oh, and apparently… my cousin’s across the street neighbor.





Two





Levi.



A blank canvas.

Otherwise known as the bane of my whole fucking existence.

Unfortunately, I was now intimately familiar – too familiar – with the taunting off-white expanse mounted on the easel in my studio.

Creativity had evaded me for a while now.

Ever since my mother died, the usual allure of the pigments had been painfully absent, skipping over me in favor of what seemed to be… everybody else.

All my peers in my creative circle, from photographers to sculptors to recipe bloggers to spoken word artists, everyone was creating.

Everyone except me, it seemed.

It was to be expected, I guess.

I’d gone through a similar period of stagnation after the death of my father, which had hit me hard. I was close to my parents, talked to them often, no matter where in the world I was. When my father was diagnosed with cancer, I put my traveling on hold, feeling like I needed to be close.

I was right.

It took him quickly.

Soon after that, I quickly discovered that what had been pulling me home was the impending need to be available to comfort my mother – not to simply share space with my father in his last days. They'd been married 37 years, a little longer than I’d been alive. It was hard for me, sure, losing my father. My mother, on the other hand, had lost the love of her life.

So I made myself available.

Sure, I still traveled some when necessary, but often I simply took her with me. I was able to show her something new, to capitalize on my father urging her, at his deathbed, to see and do as much as she could with the rest of her life.

I did my very best to make that happen for her.

But just after Christmas, she'd been called back to her hometown because of an accident in the family. She was going home to take care of her hard-headed father, who had fallen off a ladder while doing some gutter repairs he was supposed to have left to people who weren’t eighty-years old with arthritis. He was having a hard time getting around, with the ankle injury he suffered from the fall.

While she was there, while she was out picking up groceries and other things he needed around the house… she was hit by a drunk driver.

One of my most vivid memories of that time was of the police telling us she died on impact, and hadn't experienced much, if any, pain.

As if that made it better.

Breaking news: It didn't.

In the months that had passed since then, I hadn't been able to create anything that wasn't commissioned. Someone else telling me what the end result should look like, versus something I had to pull from the dark recesses of my own head.

There was one lone exception.

Havana.

After Havana, or more accurately, after Jemma, there had been these two weeks where things have been beautiful for me. I wasn't consumed by grief. My hands didn't feel like useless blobs of skin attached to the ends of my arms. My brain wasn't foggy.

I was able to paint.

I was able to create.

A portrait actually, of the woman whose company had felt like a sanctuary in the middle of an emotional storm.

Jemma.

Of course, that wasn't the name she'd given me. She'd given me Kira, an obviously fake name that she barely remembered to respond to, but that was fine. Names hadn't been very necessary for what we were doing.

Our bodies took on the bulk of communication.

I glanced at that portrait now, admiring my approximation of her glowing copper skin, big brown eyes, and that lush, perfect mouth.

Soft curves, and soft skin.

Ass.

So much ass.

But of course, that wasn't included in the portrait, just vivid in my memories of her, and the time we spent together. In the portrait her braids were wild, lips parted, eyes still flush with pleasure.

It was a fond memory of a look I’d vastly enjoyed putting on her face. An expression I’d gifted her with over, and over again. And of course, she’d gifted me with more than a few deep pleasures too.

Remarkably attractive, wickedly fun, deeply sensual, incredibly intelligent, worldly without being haughty or arrogant. She felt like a blessing.

I'd been wandering. Traveling aimlessly, with no rhyme or reason, no purpose to my life. And then, in that sweltering little bar deep in Havana, I sat down for a drink. She was the one who approached me, walking up to my table and leaning in, giving me a fantastic view of her cleavage and a big, bright smile.

“I know an American when I see one,” she’d said.

And it was on from there. For two days, and two nights, no one existed but us. Sex, room service, and Cuban rum, for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

By the time we passed out of pleasure-induced exhaustion on that second night, I knew what I had to do. Knew I had to get away while I could, let it all go before I took it further than it needed to go. She was like a drug I couldn't let myself get hooked on.

So before she woke up the next day, I left.

I hadn't seen her since then.

Until yesterday, of course.

Just as fine as I remembered, in a soft yellow dress that gave her skin even more of a glow. She’d changed her hair, no longer wearing the braids from my memory. Now it was straightened, long and loose around her shoulders with golden highlights that made her look like some type of goddess of Summer.

It felt like fate.

It had to be, right?

What other explanation could there be, when at just the moment I was succumbing to my inability to create, the very woman who had proven herself as a muse stepped back into my life?

At my neighbor's cookout of all places.

I was barely ever home – especially since my mother passed, I preferred to be in unfamiliar places – home was rife with too many painful memories, usually.

It was only because of a flight that had been canceled and not rescheduled that I was even home at the time Joseph, spotted me, and insisted I come and join their festivities, or at the very least fix myself a plate.

Unfortunately, that short encounter hadn't proven enough to get my creative juices flowing again.

But there was something else that might.

I left my studio and took a shower, grabbing a bottle of whiskey and a glass of ice before I picked up my tablet and took it to my bedroom with me. I poured myself… more than a shot worth… and settled in, checking my social media notifications and doing a bit of socializing before I moved on to my true goal.

I tapped around on the screen, pulling up my e-reader app to navigate to the built-in store, with a specific agenda in mind.

To purchase Jemma’s book

Speak, Play, Grub.

I smiled at the book’s tagline - a Black woman’s guide to culture and cuisine, language and leisure, introspection and intimacy around the world - and then moved forward to read her acknowledgments, the foreword by Toni Wright, who’d published the book through her Scattered Seeds publishing company, and then on to the first chapter.

In no time at all, I was hooked.

As a writer, Jemma’s voice was exactly what I knew her to be. Fresh, humorous, with a healthy dose of sensuality that made it very easy to devour page after page. Before I knew it, I’d made it to chapter five, which had a very familiar heading.

Havana.

It was like deja vu, reading her account of the way we’d met. Of course, she started the chapter with other topics - tales of learning more about the regional dialect, immersing herself in the local culture, experiencing authentic Cuban food, all of which were fascinating subjects, sure.

But then, her storytelling arrived at me and her, and that was where things got really interesting, to me.

It was quite enthralling, reading her first impressions of me. She noticed the melancholy in my eyes, noticed my subdued emotional energy. But she saw something else too – she saw my passion for life even in grief, saw my deep yearning for creative expression, appreciated my respect for travel and international cultures.

According to her…I just had a good vibe.

And, according to her… I was incredibly sexy.

The feeling was mutual Ms. Love, I mused to myself. The feeling was very, very mutual.

And then, of course, there was the sex.

There was sex in some other chapters too, but she approached her retelling of our experience differently than the others. With a certain reverence and respect that permeated every word on the page. According to her, it was special.

It had shifted something for her.

She’d left our experience changed.

When he touched me, there was no rush, no urgency to his movements. He knew I was his for as long as we had together in our little villa. And I most certainly was his, in every sense of the word.

I would have done anything he told me to do to him, or to myself, anything to keep the pleasure on his face while I rode his dick. He was touchy — oh, so touchy. His thumb rocketing against my clit, torturing me with pleasure while I rode him, hard, his other thumb shoved between my lips.

“Suck it,” he urged, the same gentle command he’d given me before, while I bruised my knees on the hard stone floor in front of him, trying my best to swallow him whole. His hands tangled in my braids, mascara ruined and running down my face, gagging as I struggled to take him down my throat, struggled to accommodate him.

But I wanted this, wanted it so bad, wanted to taste and feel him, needed to feel the hot spurt of his release down the back of my tongue. Needed to swallow it, needed him to know I was serious about this shit.

Needed him to know I was no selfish lover.

Not after I'd already cum countless times with his head between my thighs, because he couldn't seem to get enough of it. My pussy was like heavenly manna for him, necessary sustenance for every next second of his life.

After his tongue, there was his dick. Long, thick, an impossibly perfect fit, filling and stretching me, driving me head on to an orgasm that felt like an extinction-level event.

If I had a job, I’d quit.

Just so I could fuck him all day.

It was just that good.

And he knew he was good, not arrogantly, just as a point of fact.

I let him put it anywhere he wanted, and he wanted to put it everywhere.

And every time, he made me cum, made my body produce sounds and shivers and fluids at levels I had no idea were even possible.

The kind of sex that completely shifts you.

The kind where you have to come to grips with the fact that nobody else is going to do it to you like this again.

The kind where you had to just be grateful for the experience.

Plenty of people never get it.

“Well, damn,” I muttered, leaning back against my pillows and cupping my uncomfortably engorged dick. Consuming her words had taken me right back into those moments of bliss, right back into the sights, sounds, smells, feelings.

She was right — that experience had represented a shift.

One week, two weeks, two months ago, I would have done a whole lot to find myself immersed in the experience of Jemma's pussy again.

Now, I knew I didn't have to do that much to get to her.

She was close as hell, easily within my reach, assuming, of course, that she wanted it.

Now… it was just a point of getting an answer to that question.

Does Jemma want me, like I want her?

I would get that answer soon enough.

In the meantime… I had some reading to finish.





Three





Jemma



“Whoa. Whoa. This is the nigga from chapter five?”

I pushed another spoon of honey vanilla ripple into my mouth and nodded, confirming Jac’s words as we gathered around her laptop propped on the counter at Dreamery. It had taken me a few days to fess up to it, but… the proverbial cat was out of the bag now.

Joia snickered, her spoon dangling inches about her half-finished cup – inches away from her prominently rounded belly. She was coming up on seven months now, and it showed.

“No wonder you wrote a whole chapter about him. That is a beautiful man. Look at his mouth. Look at his lips. And look at his hands,” she groaned, then sighed, then scooped up a heaping portion of ice cream and stuck it in her mouth as she leaned onto the counter with a plaintive sigh. “God, I need Teddy to bring his ass back to Blakewood.”

It was my turn to laugh then. “Umm… didn’t he just leave this morning?”

“Right,” Jac teased, her face pulled into a smirk. “And you’re already like, dangerously horny. Seek help.”

Joia’s head popped up. “I know you aren’t talking, like you didn’t almost catch a public indecency charge with Kadan like two days ago. Two apartments between you and you still wanna fuck outside. Ya nasty.”

“Kadan is subletting,” Jac countered, and I frowned.

“What the fuck does that have to do with literally… anything?” I asked, laughing at both of them.

Jaclyn shrugged. “I mean… I don’t have a real defense, but I had to say something, right?”

“Wrong,” I laughed harder. “Man… I never imagined there would come a time when both of you were so wrapped up in dick. That’s my role, I thought?”

Joia giggled. “Well, in our defense, I’m pretty sure we’re both more wrapped up in the man attached to the dick – the dick is just a perk.”

I nodded my agreement. “Speaking of dick though – and then we gotta talk about something else – y’all… what the hell do I do?”

“You go another round with him and then hop a flight to Colombia, duh,” Jac said, moving to the computer at the counter. Dreamery wasn’t technically open for the day yet, but we regularly worked around our schedules to get time like this with each other whenever we could.

“He’s Joseph and Devyn’s neighbor,” I reminded them. “Which adds a whole other layer to this. He literally has an invite to the cookout.”

Joia shrugged. “Okay what’s the problem though? It’s not like you’re just always at their house or something, and doesn’t he travel like you anyway? He’s probably barely there.”

I sighed. According to Devyn, she was right – Levi was barely even at home, but still.

“I get what you’re saying,” I spoke up. “But, y’all know this is not how I operate – I don’t wife ‘em, I one night ‘em.”

“You two-nighted this one,” Jac reminded me.

I huffed. “Okay, fine, but my point stands. I’m not trying to get attached to anyone, so I have the experience, and once it’s done, I’m done.”

“Okay… sooo… what’s the problem?” Joia asked. “If you have your “one time only” mantra that you’re sticking to, what is even the point here? If you’re done, you’re done.”

Jaclyn sucked her teeth. “She ain’t done – that’s what the problem is,” she laughed. “Levi knocked her pussy off the hinges, and she can’t let it go.”

“Off the hinges?” I countered, laughing, which was really all I could do, because… well… she was right.

I was having a hard time letting go.

Since Levi, all my sexual experiences had been rather… tepid.

Which was a problem for me.

“That’s what I said, cause that’s what I read,” Jaclyn replied, grinning at me. “So I think you should take him for another ride. Have fun. Maybe make him your “in-house” dick.”

“Oooh,” Joia mused. “You two could meet up whenever you’re in the same place, since y’all both travel. A rendezvous in Morocco, in Thailand, Antigua… wherever. How sexy would that be?”

I shook my head. “For someone else, incredibly. For me… I don’t know. I’m not trying to be tied down like that. Ever.”

Joia and Jaclyn exchanged a look, and then Joia went back to her ice cream, Jac back to whatever she was doing at the computer.

“What?” I asked, prompting both to return their gazes to me.

“Nothing,” Jo insisted. “Not… really. It’s just… do you think you’re so anti-attachment because of Shawn?”

Shit.

Just hearing his name sucked a little of the air from my lungs.

“What the hell does he have to do with anything?” I asked.

Jac cleared her throat. “Um… maybe… everything? You were engaged, Jemma.”

“Yeah, I know the story – I lived it,” I quipped. “I had the perfect job, the perfect wrapped bob, the perfect fiancé… until I didn’t. So I decided to be a hoe. Happily, might I add.”

“Until you meet this one dude who throws you for a loop and you’re scared to do him again because… you’re scared of getting attached. Because of what happened with Shawn,” Joia blurted out, then scooted away from me a little, her expression wary.

“Oh my God, it has nothing to do with Shawn,” I insisted, with much less fervor than my annoyance wanted me to give those words. Because… did it have something to do with Shawn?

The relationship had ended six years ago, for typical reasons – he was a cheating bastard, and I was tired of ignoring the obvious. It was something I should’ve been able to move on from fairly easily, and I likely would’ve… if one of the people he was cheating with didn’t have a man of her own – a particularly angry one, who’d kicked in my door and put a gun in my face looking for Shawn.

Shawn ended up getting shot… a lot.

The guy went to jail, obviously, but that was a lot to handle at twenty when your name wasn’t Jaclyn Love. Jac probably would’ve pistol-whipped that man with his own gun and sent him on his way, but I, Jemma Love was a little fucking traumatized.

Of course I realized that was an extreme situation, and of course I didn’t think anything even close to that was going to happen again.

But it was possible.

So between that possibility, and the usual pain of betrayal and grieving the end of a relationship, and grieving the death of someone I loved… It was so much easier to just get the only thing men had – live dick – that I couldn’t find elsewhere, use it until I was done, and then be on my merry way.

So… passively, maybe it did.

And?

“The bottom line is, I do not want to want this man,” I explained. “So, if you two could kindly just… stop teasing me, and help. What do I do?”

Joia smirked. “Well… you know what Mama taught us about this, right?”

“The best way to get over a man…” Jac trailed off, knowing I could easily finish the popular statement on my own.

Get under a new one.





Damn I look good.

I grinned at my reflection in the mirror as I smoothed my dress over my hips.

I fully intended to follow my mother’s old advice, even though I was sure she’d act scandalized if I actually talked to her about it. She already had a million things to say about the content of my book… as if I hadn’t noticed her copy was particularly well worn, and full of highlights.

I loved that woman so much.

Anyway – I had a task at hand, one I was committed to carrying out. I double-checked my hair, double-checked my makeup, made sure I had condoms and wipes – hoe supplies – in my clutch with my cell and keys and mini-taser and pepper spray, then slipped my feet into my heeled sandals.

It was time to go.

I would scope out the scene at the hotel bar first, seeing if I could snag myself somebody’s big brother or young uncle traveling for Blakewood’s Summer Block Party festivities that were starting soon. If I didn’t have any luck there, I’d go across town to Refill, a safe distance from the undergrads, and Logan Lewis was performing tonight.

That would definitely bring the mature crowd out.

I checked myself in the mirror just one more time, then forced myself to get out the damn door before I found something wrong.

I took my time down the hall, getting my mind right before I made it downstairs to the bar. This was another thing I didn’t do – going on the prowl to forget someone. My usual hunting habits were strictly appetite based, but I was in emergency need of readjustment.

For my appetite and my attitude.

Shit.

As soon as I pushed the button for the elevator, I started second-guessing my decision to go out tonight at all.

I was all about sexual liberation – I proudly honored my body by respecting and indulging my sexuality. I really didn’t give a shit what anyone else thought about it and refused to be offended by the “hoe” label.

Embraced it.

But… using sex as an avoidance tactic wasn’t really… me.

Not in this context, at least.

Working off anger, taking a break from sadness, getting in some stress relief, fine.

Toss-up sex with a random to avoid thinking about amazing sex with Levi?

That shit is barely logical, Jemma.

I pushed out a deep sigh and turned around, and was already around the corner to go back to my room by the time I heard the elevator chime to signal arrival. Already, I felt better, my mind playing through the prospect of a long, hot bath in that jetted tub. Maybe some room service.

I stopped at my door, digging through my clutch for my room key as I planned a whole new course for the night in my head.

“Jemma?”

My fingers stilled at the sound of that voice, and I looked up to find Levi Anders strolling down the hall in my direction, an overnight bag – the same one he’d had in Havana – slung over one shoulder.

The breath rushed from my lungs.

“Levi… what are you doing here?”

That sexy smirk crept up on his face as he closed the distance between us, stopping just inches in front of me. “I check into a hotel for a mental break sometimes, even when I’m at home. Feels like I’m on a trip.”

“Makes sense,” I nodded. “Like a staycation.”

“Something like that. Looks like we’re neighbors here too,” he said, pointing at the door a little further down the hall – the next door.

Shit.

He looked, smelled, sounded so good.

I had to get the hell away from him.

My fingers closed around my key card and I whipped it out, passing it in front of the sensor on the door to unlock it. I’d already pushed it open when he spoke again.

“I read your book.”

I stopped, eyes closed. I didn’t open them again until he was right behind me, close enough to feel the simultaneous warmth and minty coolness of his breath on my neck.

“What do you want from me?” I asked, just above a whisper, even though I already knew the answer.

His hands went to my hips, pulling me into him as he leaned in, pressing those insanely perfect lips of his against my bare shoulder.

“Everything.”

I pulled away, turning in the door to face him, already out of breath. His gaze rested on my face and then traveled lower, taking me in – so intensely that I could feel everywhere it landed, and my nipples beaded in response.

I stepped aside in the open doorway, leaving room for him to get through in my unspoken invitation.

He accepted.

The door had barely swung shut behind us before he was on me, cupping my face in one hand as his mouth crashed over mine. The other hand snaked into my hair, his fingers settling into a gentle but firm grip to keep me exactly where he wanted me. I settled right into his hold, with zero hesitation, fisting handfuls of his tee shirt as his tongue lapped in my mouth.

So easily.

He fell into a seat on the chair in the corner, pulling me with him, into his lap. He tugged down the top of my dress, freeing my breasts from the confines of the fabric before covering one of my nipples with his mouth. His hands went to my ass, gripping and squeezing as he sucked my breasts, back and forth, dividing his attention between the two.

“Fuck, Jemma,” he grunted, looking up to meet my gaze. He fisted my hair again, dragging me in for another breath-snatching kiss that didn’t last nearly long enough before he pulled away. “Take this off,” he demanded, referring to my dress, and I didn’t hesitate.

I stumbled on my heels climbing out of his lap, but he caught me by the hips, steadying me before his fingers found my zipper and tugged it down. My dress fell away, leaving me in nothing but a pair of microscopic panties – a view Levi obviously appreciated, judging from the harsh breath he pushed out.

He leaned back in the deep confines of the chair, staring at me for a long while before he sat up, extending his arms to plant his hands on either side of my hips. “You’re perfect,” he declared in his deep rasp, as his fingers sank into my flesh.

“You left,” I countered – a response that surprised both of us.

His eyebrows went up, and mine did too – a movement he must’ve taken as a challenge instead of the confusion it actually was.

“I had to,” he told me, moving to the edge of the chair. The positioning put his nose right in line with my pussy, and he inhaled, deep. “Let me make it up to you.”

It wasn’t a question.

It was another of his imperatives, and my weak flesh and I went right along with it as he propped my foot up on the arm of the chair and slid my panties aside. Not that I needed any sort of apology, but I much preferred this use of his mouth. His hot tongue lapped at my slick, sensitive flesh, prodding and teasing and licking until there was a sticky mess between my legs he seemed intent on slurping clean.

With one hand, he gripped my ass, helping me stay upright through the onslaught of his mouth on my pussy – with the other hand, he added to the pleasure, dipping his middle finger into me for lubrication before he pushed it into my ass. His thumb went into my pussy, and he pressed in on either side of that dividing wall, stroking both places as he covered my clit with his mouth.

My pussy clenched tight as my pleasure coiled in my stomach, and the one leg that was holding me up gave out. Only his grip kept me upright as a blissful scream ripped from my throat, and my body convulsed with the spasms of a powerful orgasm as it tore through me, leaving me momentarily unable to breathe, unable to move, just… pure euphoria.

I collapsed onto the ottoman, just watching, as Levi pulled himself up from the chair.

“There are wipes in my bag,” I told him. “And condoms.”

Levi smirked at me as he licked his thumb, but he did use the wipes for his other finger. I was still catching my breath when he finished undressing, then moved the chair.

I was confused for a second, then realized why he’d moved it.

In front of the mirror.

I yelped in surprise as he easily snatched me up from the ottoman, carrying me to the chair with him. He sat down first, already sheathed in a condom, then pulled me in front of his open legs, so that we were both facing the mirror.

All I could see were his legs as he leaned forward, pressing his lips to my ass cheeks, following those kisses with little nibbles – soft, hard, then soft again. He brought his hands to my hips, pulling me backward… guiding me down onto his dick.

I couldn’t help the whimper I let out as my pussy stretched to accommodate him, and he didn’t stop until he was buried to the root. He pulled my legs apart, anchoring my thighs over his with my feet no longer touching the floor.

His hands went to my breasts, cupping and squeezing, plucking my nipples as he moved in me – not pronounced enough to be a stroke, but his length and girth caused enough friction that it was… fuck, it was good.

And I could see it all – his fingers tugging my nipples until it hurt so good, the sway of his balls hanging beneath us, the subtle in and out of his dick in me, the beautiful array of brown skin on brown skin. I couldn’t take my eyes away from it, too enthralled by the eroticism of it all, even when his teeth sank gently into my shoulder. Even when he urged one of my hands between my legs to strum my clit, and the other to pinch my own nipples. Even when he grabbed me at the waist, pulling me off his dick, slowly, then bringing me back down hard and fast, and repeating that, over, and over, and over.

But then I had to look away.

Had to close my eyes because I couldn’t take how good it was, but then he stopped, pushing my feet down to the floor and grabbing me by the neck in another of those firm, gentle grips.

“Open your eyes and fuck me, Jemma.”

So of course, I did.

And fuck me, I loved what I saw.

Loved how I looked with his hand at my neck, loved the raw lust of his facial expression over my shoulder, loved his hand between my legs as I rode him with abandon, lips parted, hair wild…

Perfection.

That’s what this was, and I hated it for being that, because it wasn’t supposed to be, not with him, not again.

His name spilled from my lips though, over and over as he lost his resolve to let me do the work and started fucking me back, slamming his hips up to meet mine. The space between my utterances and his filled with the steady smack of skin – music to my ears. I worked my hips in circles as I bounced against him, determined to give just as good as I got until I doubled over, paralyzed by pleasure.

He hooked an arm around my waist, catching me as he crashed into me one last time and then brought me backward with him, keeping his dick buried painfully, blissfully deep as his hips pumped in response to his own orgasm. I was throbbing around him, my pussy contracting with the natural mechanism of milking his dick.

My eyes closed again as my breasts heaved and I relaxed against him, trying to catch my breath. Gently, slowly, Levi pulled out of me, catching the messy condom and easing himself from underneath me to dispose of it before it got everywhere.

When he was gone to the bathroom, I pushed out a deep sigh, trying to find balance between my self-loathing and the extreme sense of euphoria I felt. After a few moments had passed, he was back, with a soothingly warm towel that he used to clean between my legs.

And then he tossed the towel away and buried his face in my pussy again.

As I gripped the arms of the chair, I made a quick decision – the easiest decision of my life.

I was just gonna go with it.





Four





Levi.



I didn’t leave this time.

But, the look on Jemma’s face almost made me regret that decision.

I woke up in her bed at the hotel to find her sitting up, staring at me with this stricken expression like she’d seen a ghost or something.

There I was, thinking she’d be glad.

I mean, she was the one who’d made the comment.

“You left.”

An accusation.

The kind of thing that only a woman upset about it would’ve said.

I didn’t want Jemma upset with me, so I stayed – simple as that. So instead of letting the moment linger into something too awkward, I sat up too. Grabbed the back of her neck to pull her into a soft kiss that finally made her blink, which was progress, I guess.

If only I could ignore the blatant panic in her eyes.

“Good morning, Jemma,” I said, pulling myself from the twisted sheets to stretch. I had no idea what time it was, but the sun was up, and streaming undeterred through the sheer curtains over the windows.

The light made her glow.

Jemma’s flustered gaze traveled from my face to my chest, down my bare stomach to my dick, then back up.

“Good morning, Levi,” she answered, her fists bunching in the portion of the sheets she was using to cover her nude body, as if I hadn’t seen and tasted every inch of her already. “Um… I… did you sleep well?”

I chuckled, propping my hands at my waist. “Yes, actually. Between that and spending the other half of the night inside you… I feel amazing.”

“Don’t…” she sighed, and shook her head. “Don’t do that.”

I shrugged. “Don’t do what?”

“Stand there with your dick out talking to me like last night was some normal thing.”

“I would argue that last night was the most normal thing,” I countered, dropping my hands to amble toward her side of the bed. “Incredibly natural.”

She rolled her eyes. “Seriously? That’s the approach you’re taking here?”

“It’s not an approach, Jemma,” I said, stopping in front of her. Her gaze went to my dick again before it came back to my face. “It’s a truth. My truth.”

Jemma’s head tilted, and she took on a look wholly different from my favorite one, but one I enjoyed all the same – her challenge look: eyes narrowed, jaw tensed, eyebrows poised and ready to provide a mirror to whatever was about to cross her lips.

“What makes it the truth? Just because you say so?”

“Is anything else required? I said my truth, no?”

Again, she rolled her eyes. “Whatever. The point is – last night was not a usual thing, and we’re not about to normalize it. This,” – she gestured between the two of us – “is not about to happen.”

“I’d never try to force you into anything you didn’t want, love.” I grinned. “But… of course, that’s the problem, isn’t it? You do want this. Or I wouldn’t be here.”

Her face pinched into a frown. “Excuse me?” She flipped the sheets back, baring that exquisite body of hers to me, her glowing copper skin now marred by the evidence of my appreciation for it – an appreciation I’d shown with my mouth. She smirked as my dick grew even harder than it had already been. “You were the one who wanted everything from me. Remember?”

“I most certainly do,” I admitted, closing what little space there was between me and the bed. I grabbed her by the calves, pulling her body toward mine, one leg on either side me. “I don’t have a problem admitting that shit either… you’re occupying that particular space all on your own.”

I licked my lips as Jemma’s soft hand wrapped around my dick, followed in quick succession by the other.

“You’re saying it’s a problem for me to admit I want something?”

I grabbed her chin, lifting it up, so her lips were only barely not touching my dick. “Isn’t it?”

Something crossed her face, shifting her expression from defiance to determination, filling her gaze with something lustfully wicked. She opened her mouth, and when she closed it again, it was with me inside. My hips bucked in reaction as she sucked, hard, her gaze locked with mine as she swallowed me all the way down to where her fingers were, and then pulled back slow, slow, slow.

Shit.

My hand went into her hair as she went to work, gripping a fistful as she sucked me off. Hands, tongue, teeth, throat… that fucking eye contact as she made the best kind of mess, gagging and humming and smiling about it all, all while my dick was buried in her throat.

I was not playing when I called this woman perfection.

“Does it still seem like a problem?” she asked, finally breaking away to take a full breath, her hands still pumping as she smirked.

I shook my head. “Nah, love. Not a problem at all.”





I really did do more with my time than just traveling and fucking.

To prove it – to myself – once I finally peeled myself away from Jemma, I went to my own room, for another shower and to get myself dressed for the day, so I could go do some work.

It helped, of course, that Jemma’s cousin had gone into labor.

If it weren’t for that, I could have easily – gratefully – been laid up with her all day, gladly recreating the time we’d spent in Havana. Because she had other things to occupy her time, I had no choice except to give my attention to my own tasks.

No lie though – it stung a little, how relieved she’d been to get that call.

I wouldn’t pretend I didn’t know that the issue was – Jemma wasn’t the type of woman to double-back on a fling. She was the woman who said she only wanted sex and actually meant it, the one you wanted to pin down and couldn’t.

The one who got away.

Except, apparently, it just wasn’t meant for her to get away from me.

It rankled her, which in turn, rankled me, because… not to be arrogant, but fuck it – I knew I’d shown her a good ass time. I couldn’t fathom any solid reasoning for her to be bothered by the prospect of another night.

Of course, logic wasn’t necessary for these things.

She had her reasons that weren’t mine and never would be, so it was probably best for me to thank my lucky stars for the opportunity, and go about my own business.

Thanks to her, I had some.

Instead of heading home, I made my way to the gallery space I’d purchased downtown – an investment that had cost a pretty penny. The plans I’d made – plans I’d hatched and refined and cultivated with the wisdom and input of my mother before her passing – were still in progress. When it was done, The Marie Anders center would house classrooms for all ages, studios for pottery, sculpting, painting, and photography, a gallery for those artists to showcase their work, and more.

What had started as a tribute to my father would be a tribute to both, and maybe I was imagining it, but… damn. The place was already crackling with creative energy. That plus the surge of inspiration I’d gotten from sharing a bed with Jemma led me straight to one of the studios that were already finished – my personal one, reserved for my use away from home.

I propped up a fresh canvas, a big one, one of the many I’d personally mounted for use in the studios. I grabbed a palette and gathered my paints, mixing and testing for the rights hues and tones, not settling for anything less than perfect.

It was what my subject deserved.

I picked up a brush and got started, in bold, broad strokes at first. To create the shapes. And then, little by little, the details layered on, turning the crude shapes I’d started with into something more substantial.

Something more… her.

I kept going.

Even as my shoulders, hands started aching, even past the time my alarm went off reminding me to eat, twice, I kept on, and on, until I was gazing back into the face of the very beauty I’d left this morning.

Jemma, again.

Without the braids this time, and with a different expression than the first. This time, it was that you got me fucked up face, the one I knew to take seriously, but still the same one that, perhaps irrationally, turned me the hell on.

“Beautiful,” I muttered, then smiled at the canvas, wondering what the actual woman was doing now. More than twelve hours had passed since we parted ways – long enough that I was missing the feel of her body, missing the taste of her pussy… but, she’d assured me I wouldn’t get a chance to indulge again.

It was nice running into you again.

That was people’s polite way of brushing you off, the courteous dismissal of someone you never planned to see again. They were the words Jemma used as we parted – as she discharged me from her hotel room and her presence, palpably hoping that our paths never crossed again.

Only… it hadn’t been nice running into her.

Just as she’d said in her book, it had been… perspective shifting.

Not even remotely the type of thing you just walked away from like everything was still the same – or worse: the type of thing you forgot.

Whether or not she wanted to admit or accept it, there was something between me and Jemma – some force insistent on bringing us together.

Obviously, I wasn’t going to push it. I didn’t believe in forcing things outside of their natural path if I could help myself.

But I certainly wasn’t going to fight it.





Five





Jemma



“Jem… I need a big favor.”

I sat up in bed, groggy as hell from yet another sleepless night. It had been a week since my little tryst with Levi in my hotel, and I hadn’t had a single night of peace since then.

He’d really, really messed my head up.

Not even a rendezvous with my trusty bedside boyfriend had been able to clear my mind, which was honestly a little bit terrifying. I depended on orgasms, needed them to clear my head and regulate my moods, besides the fact that they just flat-out felt good.

Had giving in to this man really messed my head up?

Anyway, back to the matter at hand.

“Devyn,” I replied to the person on the other end of the call that had roused me from my sleep. “What, what is it?”

She sighed. “Well, a few little ones at the kids’ daycare have a nasty bug going around. I'm trying to keep it from ending up in my house, and especially don't want the baby sick. Mine, or baby Nayara,” she said, referring to the newest addition to the family, Reese and Jason’s daughter. “Joey and I are both on call today, so… if you're not busy, do you think you could—”

“Yes,” I answered, before she could even get the question out. “You need me to watch the kids. I will. I gotchu boo.”

It wasn't that I just enjoyed children in general, but Devyn and Joseph's kids were cute as hell, and I could really, really, use something valuable to do. They were small - a toddler and an infant. Prime ages to be a proper handful, which was exactly what I needed.

“Yes,” Devyn confirmed. “I would appreciate it so much if you could help.”

I nodded like she could see me. “Yeah, no problem. Give me a second to get out of bed and take a quick shower and I'll be there. Thirty minutes tops.”

Devyn let out a relieved sigh. “Thank you, so much!”

“Not a problem at all, cousin,” I told her, then we exchanged quick goodbyes before I got off the phone.

I didn't waste time moving ahead with what I needed to do to make myself available for Devyn and Joseph’s childcare. She may have called because they needed me, but I definitely needed them more.

After my shower and brushing my teeth, I dressed comfortably in shorts and a tee-shirt, and brushed my flat ironed hair into a quick ponytail. I threw on tennis shoes and grabbed my keys, purse, and cell to leave, heading for the rental I’d reserved for my extended time in Blakewood.

It was time to head back to the suburbs.





“Auntie Jem!” Jaden gushed, rushing up to me as soon as Devyn let me in the front door of their house. I grinned, extending my arms to him.

Technically he was my cousin, but all the Wright kids called my sisters and me aunties, and as far as I was concerned, they were my nieces and nephews.

Once I’d given him a big hug and covered his sweet, adorable face with kisses, I accepted baby Josie from Devyn's arms. “Whoa,” I gushed, shifting her to my hip. “You’ve gotten to be a juicy, juicy girl, haven’t you?” I asked, tickling and making her laugh. “Look at these cheeks, and these rolls. It should be criminal for her to be this cute Dev,” I commented, covering her with kisses in the same way I did to her big brother.

Josie gave me a toothless grin as Devyn laughed and grabbed her bag. “Yeah, all fun and games until you’ve got a little boob monster hanging off your tit, smacking you in the face cause the milk isn't coming fast enough for her little greedy butt.” Devyn stopped in front of me, pulling me into half a hug. “Thank you again for coming through.”

“Not a problem at all,” I told her. “Seriously. I needed some good old-fashioned auntie time with my sugar babies anyway.”

Devon scoffed. “Sugar babies? Girl, more like sour patch kids.”

“We're gonna have fun all day Auntie Jemma,” Jaden said, wrapping his arms around my leg as he grinned up at me, looking just like a perfect caramel mixture of his mother and father.

“Look at this face, there’s no sour there. You out here lying on my babies,” I teasingly accused Devyn, shaking my head as I used my free hand to run my fingers through Jaden's short, soft coils.

Her eyebrows hiked up on her forehead, and she gave me an amused grin. “Uh-huh sure. Y'all have fun.”

I watched, smiling, as Devyn said her goodbyes to her children. It was a sight I'd witnessed before, with my various nieces, nephews, and cousins, but that never made it hit me any different.

It was sweet.

Not just the love she had for her children, but the love in her eyes when she interacted with their father as well. It struck me at that moment, that of our section of our overall family unit, I was now the only one who wasn’t having babies and getting partnered off.

Damn.

I wracked my brain, counting through my family one by one until I came back to the same conclusion.

…I was really the only one.

To my family's credit, no one was rushing or pressuring me to do anything.

Besides a little good-natured teasing from my sisters, I didn't have any undue influence over the course of my life. They were pretty comfortable letting me be. Any uncertainty about my singleness was my own, and it had very little, if anything, to do with any societal pressures, social media expectations, none of that.

All this time, I'd been happily single, to the point that I wondered if I would have even been happy had Sean and I ended up married.

Well…he was a cheater so probably not him, but anyone.

I loved my life as it was, loved my freedom to come and go as I pleased, loved having such control over my own time, and not having a great deal of responsibility to anyone. I didn't even have a traditional job I was beholden to, so my freedom was on ten.

I loved my life.

But I had to admit — just to myself, not out loud, never ever to anyone else… I was a little lonely.

And I fucking hated it.

The single girl, living life on her own terms, traveling the world, eating what I wanted, screwing who I wanted, moving on when I wanted, that was me. It was who I was.

But.

There was something missing.

Truthfully, I couldn't see myself with Devyn's life, as beautiful as I thought it was. I wasn't yearning for a husband, wasn’t longing for the big house. Even having children was something that I didn't feel that strongly one way or another about. Not with us already having so many in the family, where I could get my fill of babies and toddlers and whatever other age range anyway, pretty much any time I liked.

I didn't want that for me.

I just wanted something… else.

Some other compliment to my life that I couldn't quite identify.

But I could go into an existential crisis another time.

For now, it was time to focus on being Auntie Jemma, and giving these kids the best babysitting of their life.

Once Devyn was out the door, I turned back to where Jaden was and matched his smile. But then his grin slipped away, replaced by an impish expression as he promptly stuck his finger up his nose.

“You ready to play, Aunt Jemma?” he asked, and if I didn't know better, I could swear he’d taken on a whole new, devilish tone of voice.

I didn't understand how not ready I was for Jaden until we were fully in the throes of about the tenth thing he pulled out. When Devyn left the house was spotless, but in the span of the morning there were LEGOs, there were trucks, there were trains, there were superheroes, there was a construction site, a kitchen setup, a hospital set up, there was a racetrack, there was a grocery store, and there was slime.

And then it all started over again.

The endless loop of let’s play! was only interrupted by lunchtime.

Joseph had left meals already prepared and packed for both kids, since it was something he would have done anyway for them to go to daycare. As soon as I put his tray of grilled chicken, cutesy shapes of cheese, and vegetable sticks on his special tray in front of him, Jaden promptly flipped it over, turning all the food onto the floor.

“Don't want that.”

My eyebrows shot up. “Okay. So… what do you want then,” I asked him, kneeling down beside him at the table so that we were at the same level.

“Sandwich.” he demanded. “Peanut butter and jelly.”

I nodded. “Peanut butter and jelly it is,” I agreed. “And while I'm fixing your sandwich, I need you to get up and clean up this food you dropped, okay?”

He gave me a big nod as if we were on the same page so I turned away, straightening to a stand so that I could get started on his alternative lunch. But then I glanced back to check on him as I gathered the ingredients, and ended up taking a carrot stick to the face.

“Ohhhh. No food fighting baby,” I urged him, holding up my hands to get him to stop.

There were already toys all over the place, the last thing I needed was food too.

“But it's fun,” he insisted, then promptly turned to where Josie was sitting up in her highchair, peacefully enjoying her bottle as she watched us. Next thing I knew, she was taking a carrot to the forehead too.

As expected, she immediately dropped the bottle, hands stretched out to her sides in full-blown stress mode as the wailing started.

“No sir!” I stressed at Jaden, whipping around to stare him down. “I know you're pushing your little boundaries since your parents aren't here to snatch you back in line, but what you may not know, is Auntie Jemma has been granted full authority over here. You get your little butt over there and clean that food up, you hear me?” I warned him. “And you’d better not throw anything else.”

He stared at me for a second, mouth open, eyes full of deep betrayal like he was shocked that I’d spoken to him with any type of firmness. We'd been pretty chill all morning, because he hadn’t done anything to warrant a scolding until now.

Apparently, he wasn't really into receiving admonishment from Auntie Jemma.

As I watched, his face crumpled into a heartbroken expression, and he started wailing too, damn near louder than Josie was. Still, I knew Josie’s comfort was the more pressing issue.

I hurriedly removed her tray and unbuckled her from the highchair to get her up into my arms. I grabbed a bottle too, hoping that between the warm breast milk and the soothing pats I was giving to her shoulders, she’d be able to calm down.

“Jaden,” I said, shifting Josie in my arms so I could wipe away the stream of tears down his cheeks. “Auntie didn’t mean to hurt your feelings baby, okay?” I asked, as I continued rocking Josie, who didn't seem interested in letting up anytime soon. “But you have to do what I say okay?” I asked Jaden, and he nodded through his tears. “You can have however long you need to work your emotions out, that's fine. But while you're crying, I need to see you picking up that food. You understand?”

He nodded, and went to pick up the food, gathering up chunks of chopped grilled chicken in his little hands and returning them to the plate. Satisfied that that was under control, I focused my full attention on getting Josie-bug calmed back down.

A glance at the clock told me that, per the tip sheet Devyn and Joseph had left, it was almost time for Josie to go down for a nap. Which made sense, since she was acting just like I wanted to act when I got tired. Her plaintive sobs finally seemed to be coming down when somebody rang the doorbell, sending the loud chime echoing through the house.

Josie did not like that.

That set her off again, which set Jaden off too.

“Somebody's at the door!” he exclaimed, excited.

So excited that he accidentally knocked over the tray of food he was almost done retrieving from the floor, sending it all flying everywhere again. Before I could tell him it was okay, he was crying again too.

Shit.

Shiiiiit.

The doorbell rang again, with me having no intention of answering, because obviously I didn't have any free hands to open the door. And apparently, I wasn't going to have ears either, between two small children screaming their lungs out expressing their displeasure.

Whoever was at the door though - probably just the mail or some other delivery - would either have to wait or move on. I had to figure out something to get these kids calmed down, and both of them down for naps, so that I could have just a second of some breathing room.

I turned around, heading back to the foyer table where I’d left the list of tips the Wrights had given me. However, as soon as I stepped into the hallway, I nearly collided with a figure I was definitely not expecting to see there.

“Ahhhh!” I screamed. “What the fuck?!”

I took a couple of rapid steps backward, almost stumbling with Josie in my arms. Before I could fall, Levi reached out to grab me, holding on until I’d steadied my feet on the ground.

“What the hell are you doing here?” I hissed, trying to calm my racing heart.

He’d scared the shit out of me.

“Devyn made arrangements for me to come by today to check on the mounting of her portrait. She said she felt like it was loose,” he explained. “I rang the doorbell twice, and when nobody answered, Devyn unlocked the door for me remotely. She told me to come on in.”

Okay, I said to myself. Definitely going to kill her ass.

She was not slick with the setup.

The fact that both kids had suddenly grown quiet did not escape my notice. Josie was too busy staring at Levi, intrigued by a new face to look at to keep screaming, but when I looked around for Jaden, he was nowhere to be found.

Suddenly, I heard, “What the fuck! What the fuck! What the fuck!” being repeated at a high volume, over and over and over.

Shit!

A few steps toward the living room, I found Jaden jumping up and down on the couch as he repeated my unfortunately timed phrase as he jumped.

“Boy you know you're not supposed to be on that furniture,” I scolded him, and he immediately jumped down with a sheepish grin. “And how about we not say that, okay? Like ever?”

“But you said it,” he reasoned.

“Yes,” I told him. “Because Auntie Jemma is a bad person.”

His cute little face dropped into a scowl, and he shook his head. “You’re not a bad guy,” he corrected me, looking very hurt and scandalized that I would say such a thing about myself.

“Okay maybe not. But you still shouldn't say that, okay?” I asked, and he nodded, already over it as he moved on to go back to smashing trucks together.

I turned back to Levi to find him standing close – too close – behind me, wearing a big grin.

“You know that's going to be the first thing out of his mouth when his mama comes through that door right?” He quipped.

I nodded, with a deep sigh. “Yeah, I know. Of course it is.”

“How have you been though?” he asked, meeting my eyes with that usual intensity of his.

I shook my head, looking away. “I've been good, I guess. Just enjoying being at home, being around my family. How about you?”

“The usual. Working on the gallery, painting where I can.”

My eyebrow went up. “The gallery?”

“Yeah,” he explained. “Taking over this huge empty space downtown, for a kind of… a school, I guess. My parents were both artists as well, so this is something like a tribute to them.”

“Oh wow,” I exclaimed, still bouncing Josie on my hip. “That's… amazing.”

“I'm really hoping it will be. Honor their memories, and all that.”

“I'm sure they're looking down at you with a whole lot of pride,” I said. “How long has it been?”

Levi’s stance shifted. “About seven years for my dad. My mom… about seven months.”

My eyes went wide, and my brain immediately solved the math problem that spurred to the forefront of my mind. If it was seven months ago now, that meant that during our time together in Havana, that melancholy I felt around him was actually…

“Oh,” I said. “Levi, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.”

He shrugged. “You wouldn't have, since I wasn't exactly in a talking mood about it. I’m still not, actually.”

“Understood,” I assured him. “Definitely. We don't have to. Unless you wanted to, then yeah. But of course you don't.”

Levi smiled over my not-at-all-typical-for-me awkwardness.

It was like I couldn't help myself with him.

“I appreciate that,” he told me. “But I'll let you get back to the kids, and go check on this painting, okay?” He turned to head upstairs to Josie's nursery, where the painting in question was hanging.

“These aren't my kids!”, I yelled after him, for some reason.

He stopped to look at me, with a grin on his face. “Yes, I know.”

Heat rushed to my face as I quickly turned away, embarrassed. Of course he knew these weren’t my kids – he lived across the street from the family, and had obviously been in the house.

Surely, he recognized these kids were Joseph and Devyn’s.

I pushed away my unfamiliar anxiety, and went back to the kitchen where I replaced a calm Josie into her highchair. I grabbed the broom and dustpan and swept up the food that Jaden had spilled, not interested in the meltdown that might come if I tried to make him pick it all up a second time.

I washed my hands, fixed the peanut butter sandwich Jaden had requested, and then called him back into the kitchen for lunch.

Finally, there was some degree of calmness again.

“Well,” Levi said from the kitchen doorway, startling me again. “I got the mounting on the painting fixed. It almost looks like somebody tried to rip one of the corners out of the wall, which… don’t even understand how something like that happened.”

I did.

Oh Devyn was plotting plotting.

“In any case,” he said. “I did get it fixed.”

“I'm sure Devyn will be very grateful,” I told him, not bothering to share my theory that this was just part of her plan to get us back in the same space, not knowing that that had already happened.

“Mr. Levi,” Jaden shouted. “Don't go yet! I gotta show you my painting from school!”

I glanced at him just in time to see Jaden stuffing the rest of his peanut butter sandwich into his mouth all at once before he jumped up from the table and shot towards the stairs, up towards his room.

“Stop running with your mouth full,” I called after him, a request that obviously got ignored.

Levi chuckled at Jaden's excitement as Josie started getting fussy again in her chair. I swept her up into my arms just as Jaden returned, with not just a painting, but a whole binder full of art projects.

I shook my head. “Jaden, I don't think Mr. Levi has time to—”

“It's fine,” Levi interrupted, with an easy smile. “I mean, it's fine with me, if it's fine with you.”

Jaden very obviously didn't care if it was fine with me like Levi did, because he'd already grabbed Levi's wrist to pull him to the kitchen table, where he planted that binder and sat down, motioning for Levi to join him.

“Um... Yeah, it's fine with me. I'm going to go try to get Josie down, while you look at the book with him, okay?”

“Sounds like a plan to me,” Levi said, reaching to grab Josie's little fist. “Sleep well little one,” he kind of… sang to her, a sound that made her give him an adorable gummy grin, and made me and my pussy swoon a little.

A lot.

Okay.

Time to get away from him.

Upstairs, I changed Josie's diaper and gave her a quick wipe down before changing her into fresh pajamas. She was so exhausted from her little seven-month-old-world that her eyes were already closed before I even put her down in the crib.

Still, I hung around for a few moments just in case, making sure she was comfortable before I made any moves to leave. When I arrived back down in the kitchen, Levi was still there with Jaden, complimenting him on the variety of techniques shown in his binder of preschool art.

“Jaden,” I called. “Baby it's time for you to take your nap too, okay?”

Jaden groaned, but he flipped his book closed and got up without too much argument. “Bye Mr. Levi,” he said. “Thank you for the tips!”

“You're welcome little man,” Levi responded, holding out his closed fist for Jaden to tap with his own, something that put a huge grin on Jaden's face before he took off upstairs again.

“So… you're good with kids,” I commented, as Levi stood up from the table too.

He shrugged.

“Isn't everyone who only has to interact with them for a limited amount of time?”

I laughed. “No, not everyone. But I do see your point.”

There was quiet between us for a moment, but then…

“Have dinner with me tonight,” he said, seemingly out of nowhere. But I had a feeling that nothing was really out of nowhere when it came to Levi.

I shook my head. “I already have plans,” I lied.

“So change them,” he countered, as if it were really that simple.

I mean, it was that simple, since my “plans” were really with Netflix and a bottle of wine, but still.

“What makes you think you can always make demands like this with me?” I asked, crossing my arms. “I should just drop everything I have to do because you want me to?”

“No,” he answered with a sexy smirk. “You should do it because you want to.”

Uh-uh.

He got me with that logic before.

One second, I'm holding firm in my resistance, the next second, I'm happily trying to swallow his unborn children.

I was not going out like that again.

“I'm not going to be some sex on demand doll for you,” I proclaimed, chin in the air.

“Good,” he countered. “Because this isn't about that. That's why I asked you to dinner, instead of asking you to be dinner.”

I squeezed my thighs together. “You didn't ask, you told. But fine, you got me. I'm curious. If it’s not about sex, what is it about?”

“It's about the fact that since I met you, I've only been able to create with your face in mind,” he said. “And the work you’ve inspired has been… magnificent. At a level I've never been able to reach before.”

I raised my eyebrows. “Are you saying… I'm your muse?” I asked.

He smiled the smile of a man who knew he’d gotten what he wanted. “I'm saying… I'll pick you up from the hotel at eight,” he said, and then he was out the door before I could offer a rebuttal.

But I’d definitely be ready at eight.





Six





Levi.



Exquisitely beautiful.

That was the only suitable description for the impression Jemma made on me as soon as she opened the door to her hotel room that night.

Her hair was curled into loose waves that framed her face and hung around her shoulders, sultry deep crimson coated her lips, and a deceptively simple form-fitting black dress hugged her lush curves.

I wanted to take her right there, right in the damn doorway. Kneel in front of her and push that dress up her legs, push aside whatever underwear was hiding underneath, and… worship.

Fuck those dinner reservations.

But, when I proposed this time together, back at Joseph and Devyn's, I told her this wasn't about sex.

I intended to honor that.

The deep lust she inspired aside, I really did want to get to know her beyond the connection we'd forged through sexual intimacy. I wanted to know everything there was to know, period.

I wanted her.

So I behaved myself.

At the restaurant, I sat across from her, barely able to stop myself from staring once the server had finally left us alone to browse the menu and enjoy our wine.

Jemma looked up from her menu, meeting my gaze with a smile. "You clean up quite well," she said, picking up her glass to take a sip. "I'm used to seeing you much more dressed down than this."

"I could say the same about you," I countered, giving her a wink that made the most adorable, embarrassed smile cross her face."

"Touché." She took another sip from her drink. "So what exactly is it that you want to know about me?" she asked.

'Whatever you want to tell," I told her, honestly. "Especially after reading your book, and taking a peek around your social media profiles, I feel like I've only brushed the surface of this… beautiful, fascinating creature named Jemma. And I really try not to be a surface kind of guy."

She raised an eyebrow. "So you're telling me that what happened between us in Havana… it's not something you do all the time?"

"It's not, actually. For me, you were an anomaly, especially with what I was going through at the time. I, unfortunately don't have that ability of so many, to have… passive sexual encounters."

She tossed her head back. "Is that judgment I hear in your tone?"

"No, not at all," I assured her. "More like envy. Why the hell would I judge you for having the very experience that I've gotten to reap the significant benefits of?"

Nobody got great at sex by accident, and nobody started out that way either. One way or another, Jemma had put time into her craft, and I wasn't mad about it.

She smiled. "Oh, you'd be surprised. You said you looked around my social media, right? So I'm sure you've seen some of the knock-down, drag-out that goes on in my comments? Everything from the warnings that I'm going to hell, to the assurances that I must have some sort of disease from fucking around the world, to the very very concerned men and women who are just desperate to let me know that no man in his right mind would ever want to settle down with a woman like me. Which is obviously the end of the world. No one will ever want to make me a wife. No one would ever want a mother, who says the things I say, someone who shares the experiences I've shared. It's all quite lovely, actually," she quipped.

I laughed and shrugged. "You're right, I definitely saw some of that. But that shit doesn't faze me, and I hope it doesn't faze you. People love passing judgment based on their own values, not understanding that their ugly words, that anger and negativity they get on the internet and project toward a perfectly happy stranger... that says so much more about them than it'll ever say about you.”

Jemma sat back in her chair a little bit and nodded. "I must admit, it's very refreshing to hear. Honestly, it's rare to meet a man who isn't threatened by -hell, even the idea that a woman they want has been with another man."

"And what does that tell you about the way they view themselves and their peers, that they think their touch defiles a woman," I replied, picking up my own drink. "Yet, we like to consider ourselves the logical ones."

"Mmmmm," Jemma grunted, pulling her lip between her teeth. "Stop it. Before I have to cut this dinner short and take you back to my room."

I laughed and shook my head. "Nah, now. We said we'd get to know each other, so that's what I intend to do."

"Sure," she smirked. "We can roll with that…for now. So what else do you want to know?"

"Are we going to play twenty-one questions now? That's how you want to do this?"

She shrugged. "I'm just the muse, Mr. Anders. It's really your show."

"So you'd embrace that role for me?" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

"I didn't say all that," she replied. "I don't even know what it entails."

"Nothing you wouldn't enjoy. Immensely."

Across the table, her eyes narrowed, and she gave me this sexy smile that made me hard. "Oh I'm sure I would. And it would be enough if I were solely driven by my libido. Unfortunately for you…despite my obvious inability to resist your D2B-"

"D2B?"

"Dick too bomb," she explained, then quickly brushed off my interruption. "Despite my weak ass flesh… the promise of pleasure isn't enough to make me override all my personal convictions to play Girl with Pearl Butt Plug for you."

My eyes went wide. "Girl with the… wow," I laughed, as she shrugged.

"I'm just saying. As enjoyable as that might be, I need… more than that."

I nodded. "Okay… Tell me what you need then."

"Oooh. Give you an instruction manual to fuck me over?"

"Ah," I sighed. "There it is. The answer to the question that's been nagging the back of my mind - what exactly is Jemma running from?"

Her eyes narrowed, and I could practically hear the "who the fuck do you think I am?" running across her mind.

"What makes you think I'm running from anything?" she asked, clearly annoyed by my assumption.

I ran my fingers through the condensation on my glass. "Isn't every traveler?"

"Isn't every traveler what?"

"Running from something," I said. "Boredom. Depression. Family. Commitment. Poverty. Incarceration. Accountability. Grief. Something. It's something for every single one of us."

She cleared her throat. "Interesting theory. And you think I'm running from…?"

"Getting fucked over again."

Whatever her response would've been, it was interrupted by the server returning to take our orders. Once we were alone again, I met her gaze with a smile.

"You gonna tell me if I'm right or not?" I asked.

That question made her drain the rest of her drink, then clear her throat.

"Maybe?" She admitted. "I was engaged before. It ended… tragically, I guess."

"You guess?"

"I know," she said. "My fiancé was cheating, so I broke up with him. But then just a little bit after, while I was still grieving the relationship, I got a knock on my door. From the boyfriend of the woman he was cheating on me with. Actually, knock is a misnomer. He kicked my door in and put a gun in my face."

"You're serious?" I asked, frowning.

"Unfortunately, yes. He didn't hurt me or anything, but that didn't make it any less terrifying," she explained, brushing her hair away from her face.

"Yeah, I can imagine. That's fucked up."

"And that wasn't even the end of it," she went on, shaking her head. "He did catch up with my fiancé. He killed him, then killed himself. So it was just fucked up all around, and pretty traumatizing, honestly. For a while, I tried to just go back to life. I was working, and after a while I tried to date, and I just tried to be the girl I was before. But I wasn't the girl I'd been before. I didn't know who I was, I just knew I wasn't her anymore. And I knew I couldn't figure that out while I was still doing the same things I used to do. So by your logic... I ran away from the sameness, the uncertainty, the boredom. I ran away from this idea of staying in Blackwood for the rest of my life, and finding a cute little husband, and a cute little house, and having cute kids. Ran away from what was expected."

"You're still running now," I said. "That's not a critique, just an observation. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just the mode you're in right now."

Jemma leaned in, propping her elbows on the table, chin in her hands. "And what mode are you in right now? What are you running from?"

"Grief," I answered immediately. "Lack of creative energy. I met this amazing woman in Cuba and had the privilege of this…insanely gratifying intimate experience... I'm running from the fact that she's running from me."

"That doesn't even make sense," she accused, but was unable to suppress a smile. "In Havana, you were the one who ran from me."

"You're not going to let me forget that, are you?" I chuckled. "That's fine, I'm not afraid to admit that I ran. Yeah. You were... some kind of intoxicating, and I knew I had to get away. I'm done with that now though."

"Why?" she asked, her face a beautiful mask of curiosity that brought a hint of a smile to my face.

"Because, something about you, brings out something in me, that I feel like I cannot live without."

Jemma shook her head. "Okay, now you're just talking crazy."

"Whoa," I cautioned. "Don't take that the wrong way. I'm not saying that I think you're my soulmate or my future wife, nothing necessarily like that."

She laughed. "Nothing necessarily. Meaning, it's exactly like that, you just don't know or maybe we don't want to, put a name on it."

"That may be correct," I admitted. "I'm just trying to ease your mind that I'm not some stalker, that I'm not trying to put a ring on your finger tonight, not trying to take anything there. I'm not a man obsessed. Or shit... maybe I am. But is that really such a bad thing?"

"That's yet to be determined," she said. "While you're making yourself clear, I want to make myself clear too. There is no part of me that's interested in being tied down. In all my traveling, I have discovered that it's just not in my nature."

I nodded. "Okay, so tell me what is in your nature? We're back around to this again, to me asking you to tell me what it is you need. Lay out your terms, love. I'm willing to negotiate."

"You sure do know how to talk a good game, Levi Anders." Jemma settled back in her chair.

"That's the thing, Jemma, it's not game. It's just my truth."

"Oh, that again," she grinned. "Levi's truth."

I shrugged, "Yeah, here we are again. You're avoiding the question."

"I'm avoiding the question because I don't have an answer," she admitted. "Trust me, it has been a major point of contention between me, myself, and I, that I really don't know what it is that I want."

"But you know you want me?" I asked.

She met my gaze. "Yeah. I do."





"Wow."

That one word, breathed with such awe and reverence, did more to gratify me and cement my positive feelings about this space than anything else over the last few months of watching it come together. It made me that much more confident about this place opening in just a few weeks.

I watched as Jemma stepped into the large open space after I'd unlocked the door of the Marie Anders Center for us. The sexy, strappy stilettos she wore accentuated her long legs as she turned, her gaze darting around the room to take it all in. This space where we were standing now would be the gallery, big and open, the first thing people saw when they walked in. The studios and classrooms were toward the back, and would be nice spaces too once they were done.

But this was the showpiece.

Floor to ceiling glass windows that extended from one end of the building to the other, specially treated so that the rays from the sun wouldn't damage any of the artwork. That would be the space for everything, room to show off work from the students and other local artists alike, to help them get the visibility they deserved.

I wanted a space that would really add to and enhance, that would invest in the community of Blackwood. The same way that the scholarships my parents founded had helped many art majors attend BSU. Those scholarships would go on through endowments, funded by investments they made before they died. Their gift would live on for years, and I would make sure that I picked up that banner before I died as well.

This was something else though.

This was something that the whole community could see and be a part of, something that wasn't exclusive to the students at BSU.

I just wanted to be as valuable as they were, give back as much as they did.

Based on Jemma's reaction, I was well on my way.

"Levi, this is amazing," she gushed. "When you mentioned a gallery space, of course I thought it was cool. But I don't I think I imagined this. This is huge. And it'll be open to the whole community, right?"

"Yeah," I nodded.

"I'm thinking about the jobs you're creating with this. The kids who wouldn't otherwise have an outlet that will be able to come here and express themselves through something positive."

"Yes," I smiled. "All that."

Jemma turned to me with a grin. "You're being super low key about this, like it's nothing."

"Nah," I shook my head. "Not at all. It's…everything. I'm just taking in your reaction. Letting it all marinate and sink in."

"Okay," she nodded. "Well, come on. This is all empty right now, but there must be something else in here to look at, right? Show me everything, take me on a tour. That's what got me here, after all."

That was true.

After dinner, I certainly hadn't been ready to let her go, but I was trying not to end up back in her hotel room either. Not because I didn't want her - it wasn't that at all. But I did feel like I had a point to - that sex wasn't a necessary part of our connection.

So I brought her here, to the center, with a promise that I'd give her a private tour.

"Okay, come on," I said, grabbing her by the hand and lacing my fingers through hers. She looked down at where our hands were joined together, staring at them for a second. I half expected her to pull her away, but she didn't.

"Fine," she agreed, with a smile. "Lead the way."

So I did.

I took her around the whole space, showing her the classrooms and private offices, then the kitchen and break room area. Then, we moved on to the studios, with me showing her the places that would be available for local artists to lease for short or long periods, and perhaps even do art installations and private shows.

And then we made it to mine.

As soon as Jemma stepped in, she sucked in a breath. I kept my eyes glued to her face as her gaze went to the two portraits that were now both hanging up in my private studio here at the gallery. Her steps were slow as she ventured further inside, and I closed the door behind us.

"You painted these?" she asked, not looking away from the portraits - her portraits - hanging up on the wall.

"Yes."

She let out a sigh.

A gratified one.

"Wow. I mean... of course I saw the painting you did of Devyn in the nursery, and I even saw your work at the hospital too. I mean, before I knew it was you. And work online. I knew you were good, but... wow."

I stepped closer to her, resting my hand on the small of her back as I leaned in, speaking into her ear.

"This is what you do for me, Jemma. This is what you bring out of me," I told her.

She looked at me over her shoulder. "That's a lot of pressure, you know?"

"No pressure at all," I told her, anchoring my hands at her waist as I pulled her into me. "All you got to do is keep being yourself. That's more than enough."

She turned in my arms to face me. "So what are you going to do? Are you just going to keep painting my face for the rest of your life? I mean, it is a pretty good face, but I don't know how good that would be for your career."

"Are you suggesting you don't think I can create anything else?"

She shrugged. "I don't know, you tell me. Pick up a brush. Get to work. Make it happen right now," she challenged, wearing a devilish smile.

"Oh damn, is that a dare," I asked.

"Only if you're up to it," she counted.

"I'm always up to a challenge."

I didn't waste any time getting to it, taking off the nice shirt I'd put on for dinner and even slipping off my shoes.

"Ooooh, Jemma gushed. "You getting naked to paint?" she asked.

I turned to her with a wink. "Only if you want me to."

She lifted an eyebrow, staring at me for a second before she smirked.

"Uh-huh. I do."

That wasn't a problem for me.

She watched, completely amused as I stripped all the way down to my birthday suit, then picked up an apron. Once I had it on, I turned to her with my arms out, rotating where I stood to give her a full view.

"This is a very good look for you," she said. "I'm very, very into this. But I still want to see you work."

I scoffed. "I keep trying to tell you, it ain't no problem."

I went over to the canvas that I already had mounted on my easel, thinking about what I would do. But then, with the chilled air of the studio against my ass, I had a different idea. I turned to where Jemma was standing, waiting.

"You get naked too."

Immediately, her face pulled into a frown and she shook her head.

"What the hell would I get naked for?" she asked. "This show is all you."

"Right now, yeah. But how about we make it me and you? Get naked," I told her again, not waiting for a response before I walked over to one of the rolls of canvas in the corner.

I unfurled it across the floor, then went over to the stack of supplies for the classrooms stocked here for temporary storage in a different corner. I grabbed several bottles of tempera paint in different colors, bringing them back to the canvas with me. I stopped to look at Jemma, who still hadn't moved.

"Do I have to take that dress off you myself?" I asked.

She stared at me for a long moment, as if she were really considering her options.

Then she moved.

I watched, enthralled, as she unzipped the side of that dress and then slid the straps off her shoulders, letting it drop to the ground. She was braless underneath, and wearing another of those tiny pairs of panties that were maybe going to be the death of me.

"Everything?" she asked, and I nodded.

"Yeah. Everything."

She took the panties and shoes off and I took the apron off and brought a bottle of red paint with me as I approached where she stood. I opened it, coating my hands with it before I reached out to her, rubbing it over her breast and shoulders.

'You want to tell me what this is about?" she asked, and I winked at her.

"Yeah. We're about to make something beautiful."

With a hand at the back of her neck I pulled her into me, covering her mouth with a bruising kiss. I pushed my tongue between her lips, tasting her, savoring every drop of the lingering taste of the wine we had with dinner. I forgot about the paint for a second, dropping it in favor of being able to get both hands on her supple, velvety skin. I lowered my hands to her ass to grip and squeeze, pulling her against my dick.

"Come on," I told her. "Let's get started."

Jemma smiled, completely game without me having to spell it out to her - an adventurous spirit that was one of the many things I enjoyed about her.

We spread the different shades of paints on different parts of our bodies, taking care to avoid the genital areas, obviously. And then I spread Jemma out on top of that canvas that I'd rolled out on the floor, pushing her legs wide. Exposing her beautifully bare pussy to me before I buried my face between her legs.

She was so fucking sweet to my taste buds.

I couldn't get enough- I'd never get enough.

I licked and lapped and slurped until she was squirming and shaking, leaving the imprint of her beautiful body all over that canvas as I made her come.

As a matter of fact, she was still shaking when I moved positions, slipping into her pussy for the first time with nothing between us. I paused for a second, still buried deep and enjoying every second of her unfiltered wetness hugging me tight as I met her gaze with an apologetic lift of my eyebrows.

I hadn't even been thinking.

I'd just needed to be inside her.

"You're in it now anyway," she said with a shrug as she tightened her pussy around me. "But you'd better fuck me especially good now."

Yet another thing that would not be a problem.

I propped her legs up on my shoulders and proceeded to stroke hard and deep, exactly the way I knew she liked it. In next to no time, she was squirming for me, again screaming my name in a way that echoed around my studio walls.

All I wanted to do was make her come.

Again, and again, and again, as our bodies mixed and blended the pigments of paint together on the canvas with every movement.

In and of herself, Jemma was a masterpiece, but this was on a whole other level. Her breasts, her stomach, her thighs, her back, her ass… everything was covered in red, yellow, orange and gold, streaked together like some kind of molten goddess.

I groaned as I drove deeper into her tight, wet heat, relishing the feeling of her body clenching around me in those involuntary spasms of pleasure.

And her face.

Shit.

Mouth open, head thrown back, eyelids fluttering as she gave in to the bliss of me inside her. That made it even better for me, knowing just how good it was for her too.

I could live like this.

Buried deep inside of Jemma Love, making something beautiful on this canvas.

And then her orgasm hit, with a tightening of her hips and a whole new tension in her body, her nipples beading into hard peaks beneath the paint that decorated her skin. Before it could completely wash over her, I flipped her over, grabbing her by the hips and pulling her into me as I drove into her from behind.

"Holy shit," she whimpered and moaned as she threw it back at me, sending paint splatters and bodily fluids flying as our bodies smacked together.

"Shit," I groaned, as the familiar sensation built in my balls. Honestly, I felt that shit all the way down to my toes, amplified by the sight of her fat ass coming back at me every time I slid into her pussy.

She turned, looking over her shoulder at me - not with cockiness, but with pure pleasure as her body shuddered with another orgasm. "Don't pull out," she begged. "I wanna feel it all."

I swear that shit made me cum even harder as I grabbed her waist, driving into her with a loud, animalistic groan. I held onto her hips, keeping her locked against me as I pumped into her, emptying everything that I'd pent up since the last time I was in her.

We fell away from each other, gasping and panting as our bodies created a whole new imprint on the canvas.

"Whew," Jemma said. "Is that the type of stuff you guys are going to be teaching in these classrooms?" she teased, and I chuckled, shaking my head.

"Nah, love. This particular lesson was just for you."

Jemma



I pushed out a heavy sigh as I headed down the hallway of what used to be my apartment. In some ways, it was bittersweet to be here again – every so often, I kinda missed not having a permanent place to land. But on the other hand, I knew this space was better suited for someone… not me. Which is why I was here at all, really.

I fished my keys from my purse, cursing myself in my head for leaving this task to the very last minute. What I really needed to be doing was getting ready to get on a plane tomorrow night, but I did still have to tend to my responsibilities.

I was more than a little exhausted after spending a rather… creative night in the company of Levi Anders. What was supposed to be “just dinner” had turned into me getting a private tour of his art center, which turned into me face down, ass up, covered in paint. A little adventure that definitely would’ve made it into my book if it had happened sooner.

Now though… I had to find my way to some new adventures.

It was why I’d moved my flight up, not wanting to wait the extra few days for the original flight - more time to get myself further wrapped up in Levi. As great as the sex was, and as captivating as Levi was, I really, really needed to get away, while I still had the wherewithal to do it.

First, duty called.

I needed to do my inspection of my apartment for Kadan's benefit, so we could renew his lease agreement. I was technically a landlord now, and part of that was making sure the place hadn't been turned into a meth lab or something.

Something I really could’ve just taken his word for, but I liked to just make sure.

Men liked to lie about shit when they didn’t have to.

I unlocked the door and stepped in, immediately frowning over a familiar smell… sex in the air. I knew plenty about that. Only… Jac had already told me she was going to be at Dreamery all morning, and supposedly Kadan was at work too so…

Damn. Am I gonna have to kill this nigga today?

With my keyring pepper spray in hand, ready to season the whole room if I didn’t like what I saw, I stepped around the corner into the full, open view of the apartment.

“Oh God!” I shouted, quickly covering my eyes to block out the sight of Jaclyn and Kadan going at it on top of my granite counters.

“What the fuck are you doing here?!” they both said, in unison.

“I’m supposed to be here – we talked about this,” I exclaimed, peeking through my fingers to see Kadan moving to pull away and cover himself. But Jaclyn wrapped her legs around his legs, keeping him locked in the place.

“Uh-uh,” she scolded him. “We have business to take care of!”

“Actually, I have business to take care of,” I said, turning my back to them. “I'm here to do the inspection, at the time and date we agreed on. You niggas are supposed to be at work, and yet here we are with your naked asses banging in my kitchen in the middle of the day. Can we… put on clothes?”

“No,” Jac countered. “You can go. Come back later.”

“I can't come back later; I have a full schedule today. Your ass knows I'm getting on a plane tomorrow.”

I heard the tenor of Kadan’s voice, but not his words before Jac groaned. “Fine.”

I stepped into the guest bathroom to give them a little privacy while they made themselves decent again - or maybe finished what they were doing for as long as it took for Kadan to come knock on the door and tell me the coast was clear.

“My bad Jemma,” Kadan said. “I completely forgot that was supposed to be today.”

“Can we please just pretend it didn't happen?” I asked. “Jac and I talk too much, and I already know way too much about your penis, soo…”

Kadan nodded. “Well, I read some of your book and I’m pretending that didn’t happen so...” He extended a fist to me. “Selective memory loss?”

I tapped his fist with mine. “I don’t even remember what I’m supposed to be forgetting.”

“His pale, naked ass! You’re welcome!” Jac yelled from across the room as Kadan and I left her to make the trip through the apartment to do the inspection.

When we were alone in the second bedroom, without Jaclyn’s commentary, Kadan turned to me with a serious expression on his face.

“Hey, so now that I am starting to get more and more settled,” he said, “I'm really starting to think about not renting anymore. Thinking about something more permanent.”

I grinned at him. “Ooooh, are you thinking about getting a little house or something?” I asked. “Maybe so you have space for a… family?”

“Not quite yet,” he laughed. “Things are going good with Jac, but you know how her last thing turned out, so really we’re just trying to enjoy being together right now. And it’s only been a few months.”

“I understand.” I told him. “So… what are you saying though?”

“I'm saying… that I think you should let me take over this lease for you. Like for real, not subletting. I want to convert it to the building’s buy option.”

“Ahhh,” I nodded. “That's actually already what I’ve been doing. Every time you pay rent to me, it goes straight back to the balance left on this place,” I explained.

Kadan sighed. “Damn. So I guess that's out then.”

“No, actually,” I answered. “I am never here, and it’s actually started to become more of a hassle than anything. Back when I did it, I thought it was something that was going to be good for me. I thought I would be in Blakewood a lot more often than I actually am. It really doesn't make sense for me anymore to own a property, so I would be thrilled to make a shift here.”

Those words brought the huge grin back to Kadan’s handsome face. “Seriously?” he asked. “Because I am settled here, and this place is perfect for me. And… yes, potentially Jac too.”

“Seee,” I teased. “Y'all are so disgustingly sweet. Who knew the day she called me from the closet to tell me she’d busted you in your shit would turn into something?”

“Definitely not me,” Kadan chuckled. “No lie, I thought your baby sister was off her rocker.”

“I mean… she is off her rocker, but you love it,” I said. “What has it been, like two months and you're already thinking about asking her to move in with you?”

“Wow, Jemma, it was just a thought,” Kadan defended himself, and I shook my head.

“You don't have to explain it to me, I know what a gem my sister is, and I'm glad you see it too. And like you said, we remember how her last thing turned out. I let that nigga off easy because I wasn't here, and Jac had already caught that charge. But you,” I told Kadan, as I stepped into full big sister mode. “You, I will take personal,” I told him. “I vouched for you a little bit, I told her you were a good guy. Please don't make me regret that.”

Kadan put a hand to his chest. “You got nothing to worry about, Jemma, I promise you.”

I smiled and nodded. “I believe you. And we can consider this inspection done. Everything looks good. I'll get in touch with the property manager and we can figure out what our next steps are with letting you take over.”

“Sounds good to me,” Kadan agreed, extending his arms, and I met him halfway for a hug before we went back out to where Jac was in the kitchen disinfecting my countertops. I spent a little time talking with them before I had to go. I had a full day of plans before I got on this plane – yes, that was part of it. But also, my heart really couldn't take how damn sweet they were together.

Just like with Joseph and Devyn, it was hard to watch them without comparing their life to my own. I wasn't one of those people who put too much stock in “relationship goals”, especially not ones I saw online, where everybody was putting their best foot forward and only showing the good parts.

Of course, that was normal. Nobody - at least nobody with good sense - posted about it online every time they and their spouse got into an argument, every time their partner got on their nerves. Social media was the highlight reel.

But when I saw these beautiful relationships in such proximity to me, saw the obvious love in their eyes, saw the way they cared for and loved on each other… Those were the real goals. When someone could give you the space you needed because a relationship was causing extra stress, but would be right there for you when you were ready. Or like in Joia’s case, a casual fling turned into a full-blown second chance with a man who would bend over backward, do anything for her and the baby their one-night stand had created.

Seeing the people in my life falling in love – staying in love - was fucking with my resolve not to be part of their number. So… yeah, it was definitely time for me to go. I needed a reset, bad.

“What's wrong with you?” Jac asked, catching me in the hallway where I had stopped to take a breath, and obsess about my current predicament. “Is that dried paint in your hair?” she asked, reaching to pick it out. “Oooh!” she exclaimed, rapidly putting the clues together. “You've been with Levi again, haven't you?”

“Mind your own business, baby sister,” I said, waving her off.

She met that with a snicker as we headed to the elevator together. “You just saw me spread-eagled on your kitchen counter and it barely phased any of us. I don't think we have a barrier on where your business ends and mine begins,” she suggested.

I laughed “You know, you may have a point there.”

I considered it a blessing that Jac, Joia and I had never really gone through that phase that so many other sisters did, of not getting along. Sure, we got on each other's nerves sometimes, but I couldn't remember ever having that point where we like…weren't speaking to each other for longer than maybe a day, or anything like that.

As such, Jaclyn was right.

There was quite a blurry line between what I would and wouldn't tell my sisters. And the feeling was shared between all three of us. It's partially why Jac and I didn’t really trip on Joia, weeks back when she was tight-lipped about who the father of her child was - or even the fact that she’d been with Teddy again at all. It was something she wanted to keep to herself, for whatever time she could, and we respected that.

Because… hell, we knew everything else anyway.

“I'm going to have to respectfully ask that next time you guys don't share that with me,” I laughed as the elevator opened to let the two of us on. “I know we're close and all, but that's real close.”

Jac laughed. “Yeah, cause I'm pretty sure whatever you and Levi were doing for you to have paint in your hair, is something I would not have wanted to walk in on.”

I shook my head. “No, you definitely would not have wanted to be there for that. But… considering the tastes of the general public… we probably could’ve made good money on that.”

“Oh y'all nasty nasty,” Jaclyn accused, laughing.

“Hey,” I shrugged, “I'm just trying to not have any regrets when I look back over this life, okay?”

Jac sucked her teeth. “And you don't think not locking Levi and his dick down is going to be something you look back on and wonder what in the world was your problem?”

“Duh. Why do you think I moved up my flight?” I asked, laughing. “Of course I wonder if it's a mistake. But making something of that is a possibility that I don't even feel equipped to process right now. So, I'm going to do what I always do.”

“Go somewhere sunny and stop answering your phone?” Jaclyn asked, grinning as I answered with a nod.

“I've always said nobody knows me better than my sisters.”





Levi Anders was the man of my dreams.

Literally.

That face, that dick, that mouth, had all been making their way into my dreams, damn near every night.

Even before our little rendezvous at the gallery.

All part of what had fueled my incision to take off early. Last night had been especially vivid, leading me to wake up with wet panties and a really hard time not contacting him to get a live reenactment of the things my mind had played out during my slumber.

I hoped I wasn't making things worse.

Hoped I wasn't messing up.

That I wasn't employing an absence that would only make my pussy grow fonder.

That would really be messed up.

I sat back with a sigh in the airport lounge, pulling up a mindless, time-wasting game on my phone. I needed to distract my brain until it was time to get on this flight, with something other than visions and fantasies about what could never be with Levi.

Then, my phone rang.

“Jemma,” my mom’s voice rushed out in a panic, making me sit up straight in my chair. “Have you boarded your plane yet?” she asked.

“No, I haven't. Why? What's wrong?

Mama sighed. “Your sister went into labor.”

“What?” I asked. “Joia is barely seven months pregnant!”

“Yes,” my mom agreed. “Which is exactly the problem. Dev and Joey did everything they could for them down at the hospital, but they can’t stop it. The baby is coming now.”

“Okay. Okay,” I said, my hands shaking as I stood. “Okay, um… I'm leaving the airport now. I’ll use the app to catch a ride. I'm on my way.”

I didn't hesitate once I was off the phone with my mother to summon that ride and grab my carry-on, to get to the hospital for my sister. By the time I made it there, she was already in full-blown labor - Teddy and my mother were in the room with her.

Everyone else was out in the waiting room, including Teddy's parents. There wasn't much conversation going on, even though our two families got along well. We were worried about Joia and the baby on both sides. I took a seat between my dad and Jaclyn to do the only thing I could do.

Wait.

After about an hour had passed, the doors to Joia's room swung open. A whole team of people in scrubs and masks came rushing out, wheeling an incubator that undoubtedly carried my brand-new niece or nephew. They had to be heading to the NICU, to do whatever was necessary to make up for such an early delivery, and Teddy was right behind them, staying close to his baby.

My mother stepped out next, coming straight to us but addressing Teddy’s parents too. “Joia is okay,” she assured us. “They're getting her cleaned up, but I knew all you guys were out here waiting on an update. They're worried about the baby’s lungs, but everything else looks good. They’re confident he's going to be okay.”

“He?” I asked, jumping up. “So it's a boy?”

My mother beamed, reaching for Teddy's mother's hand to grab and squeeze. “Yes. Theodore the third.”

“Oh my goodness!” Teddy's mother sighed happily, and his father grinned. “We had no idea they were going to do that.”

“You can go down to the NICU waiting area,” Mama told her. “That’s where Teddy will be, watching through the window as they get him settled. If it’s not anything too major, which they didn’t think it was. Joia insisted that he stay with the baby as much as he could, and I bet he could use some company.”

They didn’t waste any time – Teddy’s parents went to go join him, and see if they could catch a peek of their new grandbaby. The Loves went to check on Joia first – there could only be so many people in the NICU at once anyway.

We walked in the room to find Joia looking fatigued, worried, but also deliriously happy as she spoke to Joseph. We hung back a little until they were done, and then made sure to speak to our cousin, but I was the first person at her bedside once she was free.

“Jo-jo,” I gushed, leaning in to press my lips to her sweaty forehead. “Girl, you had a baby. Finally a boy on our side of the family.”

She let out a tired laugh that really told the story about how exhausted she had to be. I’d just seen Joia earlier in the day – we’d had lunch together. She’d complained a little about feeling more tired than usual, and I’d walked her all the way up to the apartment after we were done with our sister date, just to make sure she was okay. We both thought it was just normal third-trimester fatigue, and didn't think too much more of it.

Apparently, we were wrong.

“It hurt like a bitch,” Joia said, shaking her head. “We skipped the epidural because it all happened so fast. I am never doing this shit again.”

We all laughed, and Jaclyn moved around to the other side of the bed, running her hands through Joia's wild hair to smooth it down. “You took this one for the Love Sisters team,” Jac said. “Cause this was stressful as hell for me, so I can’t imagine how you must feel. Not to mention… you're the tough one. If you say this shit hurts, it hurts. Definitely ain’t gone be no other grandbabies now.”

My mother laughed. “See, I knew I shouldn't have brought them in here. You are scaring them from getting me the rest of my grandbabies, girl!”

We looked up as a Devyn came in to join our little group, coming up to the foot of Joia’s bed. “Okay family, I know it's been a busy and emotional time, but we've got to let our newest mommy get some rest. We need her charged up and able to walk down to the NICU to get some skin on skin time with baby TJ as soon as possible, okay?”

“He's so tiny,” Joia said, all the amusement leaving, replaced over again with worry. “But he's so beautiful. Head full of hair. We haven’t gotten to hold him yet. I had to make Teddy go to make sure he's going to be okay.”

“Of course he's going to be okay,” Devyn assured. “Our NICU team is top notch.”

“And you know Teddy is not going to let it be any other way,” I added. “He would tear this place down for you and baby boy.”

Joia nodded. “I know. I'm just... I just need this to be okay. We found a place,” Joia told me. “After you dropped me off, he came by, and we looked through all our options again. We agreed on one. A place for the two - three of us together. A place for our family.”

“And you are going to get to be a family, Jo,” my mother assured her, the whole thing tugging at my heart in a way I hadn’t anticipated and didn’t welcome.

Selfishly.

Seeing Joia’s concern about baby TJ, seeing that worried determination on Teddy's face as he'd raced down the hall behind the incubator… it certainly wasn't an ideal situation by any means, but still.

It was… beautiful.

And that beauty made it hard to not wonder if I was missing out by not wanting it for myself.

The trouble was, with the baby being here now, and especially under these circumstances… there was no running away from those feelings now. I couldn’t up and leave with my sister and nephew in anything less than prime condition.

I had to figure out how to manage them.

Levi



Soon.

Just that thought put me in a better mood than I’d been in for days.

The cause of my less-than-cheery mood?

Simple.

My lack of contact with one Jemma Love.

I wasn't trying to be one of those dudes who just couldn't take the hint, so I hadn't sought her out. But I had to admit that it stung a little bit that she hadn't seen a need to employ the use of my number, which I had made sure to leave her with when we parted after our rendezvous at the center.

But I had to realize that was completely her prerogative.

Not a thing I could do about it.

Nothing, that is, except put my focus into my work. Not painting though, because the last thing I needed was to pour myself into another portrait of Jemma's face. No, I was focused now on these last few things required to get the center up and running, since the construction element of the renovation was pretty much complete.

Distraction was the name of the game.

“You said you were going to get this done, and I see you really made it happen.”

I looked up from clipboard containing the final list of things we had to do to find Morgan - my homeboy and fellow artist - heading in my direction. He and I went way back, to the early days of social media, where we’d both been early adopters trying to make a name for ourselves.

I extended my hand to clap his, pulling him into a half hug. “Man, what are you doing all the way out here from Blackwood? Got the names inverted on your way home from some fancy gallery showing or something?”

Morgan chuckled, shaking his head. “Nah, bruh. I came out here to see what a real deal profess-sion-nal artist looks like in his element. You know, gotta come see what’s what, gotta check things out if I'm trying to get like you.”

“Fuck that – you’re the one out here living it up. I’m trying to get like you, since you finally made that move on Elaine.”

Morgan’s eyebrows shot up. “Are you saying what I think you said?”

I shook my head. “If I'm honest with myself, not really. It's probably a pipe dream.”

“I don’t mean to be discouraging,” Morgan said, “But yeah, you probably right. Your ass is the poster boy for all those solitary artist stereotypes, almost messing it up for the rest of us.”

I couldn’t be too offended about that, because he was right.

As much as I wanted Jemma - wanted her bad - the truth was that I was a great example of the “artist archetype”. There were periods of time where all I wanted to do was be locked up somewhere in my studio for days at a time. Not beholden to anyone else, nobody waiting for me at home, nobody asking about me, questioning where I was, none of that. I just wanted to be able to be me.

Be free.

Too bad that didn't make me want Jemma any less.

“No offense taken,” I told Morgan, shaking my head. “Mostly because you're right.”

“Yeah,” he said, “I know. It must be some kind of special woman that's got you having second thoughts though.”

I laughed. “You know… that description sounds about accurate.”

Morgan grinned. “Is this her?” he asked, pointing up to Jemma's portraits on my wall, and I nodded.

“Yep. That's her.”

“She's beautiful,” he complimented as he examined the picture. “And that’s some nice ass brushwork. Good composition and layering, excellent tonal choices.”

“Yeah,” I agreed. “This is the level of excellence she pulls out of me.”

“Okay…,” Morgan turned back to face me. “That definitely makes it more understandable why you would want to lock her down. So what's the issue?”

“Uncertainty,” I answered, and Morgan pulled his head back in disbelief.

“Uncertainty? I don't buy that at all. You are definitely the most certain motherfucker I know.”

I laughed. “What does that even mean?” I asked.

“Man, we've known each other for how many years? You've been telling folks for years about what the type of artist you were going to be – how you were going to be somebody, even when nobody was trying to believe you. You were just another dude out here making corny ass art for Grandma’s living room.” He motioned around us. “But look at you now. Look at the clients who’ve commissioned you, your resume. This center. Look at what you've done. All because you were certain of your talent even when all those… notable art critics on social media were saying the exact opposite. So, I'm saying. If you stayed solid through that, then it doesn’t make sense to me why you’d believe you're not fully capable of making a decision and sticking to it about this woman. Give me a different excuse, bro. What is the hold-up?”

“Okay, I see what this is,” I said, shaking my head. “You finally stop playing games about Elaine, make that happen… and now you're the hoe days are over expert.”

Morgan shrugged. “If the shoe fits, I got no problems wearing it,” he laughed. “Seriously though - if you know you’re feeling her, what's the problem with giving it a shot? Because it might not last? Shit, the same could be said for democracy, but you still vote, don't you?”

Again I laughed at his silly ass analogies. “Did I lie though?” he asked, and I couldn’t do anything except shake my head in response. Because… no, he had not.

“I just don't want to pull her out of her comfort zone if I'm not even really sure I can be about that life.”

Morgan nodded. “Okay, that I can respect. But tell me more about her not being about that life. You stressing over a woman that’s not even checking for you?”

That was definitely a way to put it.

A correct way to put it.

“That's fairly accurate,” I admitted. “This woman is… not exactly jumping up and down to be linked to me, or anyone for that matter. But we have this connection that's undeniable. So distinct that I'm afraid to pass it up.”

“Oh so you're on some soulmate shit?” Morgan asked.

I shook my head. “No, I wouldn't exactly say that. But I do know that she motivates and inspires me in a way that no one else does.”

Morgan blew out a breath. “That is pretty intense.”

“Yeah,” I agreed. “It's pretty intense. But that's just what our chemistry is like.”

“Okay,” Morgan said. “I get you. I see where you're coming from. But my thing is, if you're feeling her like this, and she's feeling you like this… even if there's some uncertainty on both parts...”

“Relax.”

“Nah, this is like the type of shit where you get to be 85 years old, telling your biographer about this after your third divorce, cause you were searching for something you never could find again cause you let her go.”

“That is wildly specific,” I said. “Being in love really got your ass turning philosophical.

“You have to admit I'm right, though.”

I shook my head. “You might have a point. But again, I'm not trying to push her into anything she doesn't want to do. It's really just not my vibe.”

“Of course. I’m not saying you should knock her over the head and drag her off caveman style, but I am saying you have to at least make your position clear. If she's not with it, cool. But at least you won't have that regret on your mind. At least you tried. Right?”

Morgan was right.

Even as the conversation moved on to something else - to plenty of other things, as I took him on a full tour of the center to show him how everything was coming together - Jemma stayed at the back of my mind.

It wasn't new for Jemma to be at the back of my mind, but this...

This was different.

My mother had never been one to try to push me towards a marriage just so that she could get her grandkids - that really wasn't what she was about. That's not to say she didn't want them, just that she wasn't trying to pressure me into something that didn't fit with my lifestyle.

Her biggest concern was that she didn't want me to end up alone.

She had her own accomplishments, her own goals she’d met, dreams she’d reached, outside of her marriage to my father. But that didn't change the fact that she considered their relationship an enhancement to her life – one of the things she treasured most.

And of course I did too, considering the fact that their relationship had produced me.

The real point though, was that she found a high value in having someone standing alongside her, someone to spend her life with. And she wanted the same thing for me.

She had a point.

I could absolutely see the value of it, and could even see it for my own life.

I just wasn't sure I was ready to make the trade-off in freedom.

Honestly though… if Jemma were standing in front of me right now, and said “Yes, let's do this. Let's make it happen.”

I would take her up on it in a heartbeat.

What did that shit even mean?

That I would throw away all my convictions, everything I thought I knew and understood about my personal desires for an intimate relationship… for this is one woman.

“Damn bro,” Morgan said clapping me on the shoulder when I hadn’t said anything for a while. “You’ve really got it bad.”

Yeah.

I really fucking did.

Once Morgan had left, I went back to my studio to retrieve my clipboard again, intending to get back to work. But, before I could regain my focus, the latest addition to my wall caught my attention.

The masterpiece I’d co-created with Jemma.

I’d sealed and finished the canvas, mounting it on a frame. Obviously, I had no idea if something so intimate, so intensely private, would ever be made visible to the world. But for now, I could certainly admire our work of art.

One that could be the last.

Shit.

The idea of that… almost made me sick to my damn stomach.

And… it wasn’t just about the sex, it was… the thought of being around her, engaging in conversation, seeing that pretty ass smile… and, yes, putting a look of pleasure on her face.

Morgan was right.

I put my clipboard down, and took my cell phone out, navigating to Joseph Wright’s number. Then, I thought better of it, going to Devyn’s instead, since she was the one who’d been not-so-subtly trying to hook me and her cousin up.

She had the information I needed to… do something, at least.

If Jemma wasn’t interested, fine, that was a possibility I could handle.

But not even trying?

Nah… that wasn’t an option.

Jemma



I really tried not to be that girl.

I wasn't really into the whole “ghosting” people thing, or ignoring them, which is why I tried to simply not give contact information to people I didn't want to have it. If I willingly gave it to someone, and I decided I didn't want to be in contact anymore, I was good for simply saying so.

If they kept it up after that, my block button was always available.

But, when someone was respectful, weren’t getting out of line or anything like that, I tried to be decent and not leave them hanging.

Which is why not responding to Levi's text really made me feel like shit.

It wasn't even anything that serious, just a simple request for us to get together and talk. Still, it may as well have been a request for me to solve all the unanswered questions of the universe.

Hell…

That might actually be easier.

“Earth to Jemma,” Toni said, snapping me out of my daydreaming. “That was a pretty intense ten-mile stare you had going on there.”

“Sorry,” I said. “What were we talking about?” I asked, sticking my cell phone back into my pocket, and returning to my task of signing books. These were for general stock, not just at Tones&Tomes, but ones that would be shipped out to bookstores across the world.

“We were talking about a new book - about when to travel to certain places, travel deals, suggestions for international girls’ trips, solo sabbaticals, etc. An actual guide this time, instead of your memoirs, like the first book.”

I lifted my eyebrows. “You barely got the first book out of me,” I laughed. “You're trusting me with a second one?”

“Well, your audience trusts you with a second one,” Toni countered. “They’ve been asking for it. I know you won’t let them down.”

She was right.

Probably.

Before the book had even really been a possibility, my brand had been built on people following me to see pictures and commentary from where I was going. There were plenty of women who voyaged indirectly through me. While my travel was for my own gratification, I had to admit, I did often make sure that I did certain things while I was in certain places simply for the cool factor. So that people could – even just vicariously - see places they might normally not.

I was definitely in this for me, but I was in it for them too.

“Well, if you think it's a good idea, I'm all for it. I need something to occupy my brain.”

Yes, I was sticking around because Joia had the baby, but a week had passed since then, and baby TJ was still in the NICU. Which meant Joia and Teddy were spending all their time at the hospital.

I showed my face every day, bringing them hot meals, fresh clothes, and doing my best to provide general entertainment. But mostly, they were really wrapped up in their own little family unit right now, which I wasn't offended by at all. It was a stressful time while they waited on the doctors to do everything baby TJ needed.

There really wasn't space for me to be around.

Which, again, was fine.

But Joia having her baby was really the reason I had stuck around Blakewood. I wasn't ready to leave yet, with that situation still not being in the clear. But in the meantime, I was definitely going to need something to do.

Someone to do wasn't an option.

“Why do I feel like there's a story there?” Toni asked. “Spill the beans, girly,” she said, leaning across the bookstore counter.

“Just the usual “do I really want to settle down and give up my freedom” existential crisis.”

“Ahhh,” Toni grinned. “I know plenty about that one.”

I scoffed. “Right, and here you are about to freaking get married. And adopting a child!”

“What can I say,” Toni shrugged. “Life comes at you fast.”

“Real fast,” I agreed. “I just… I wish I knew what to do.”

“Okay,” Toni said. “So you're struggling with this. What is it, exactly, that appeals to you about settling down? What are the things that even really make it a consideration for you? What are the pros?”

“The pros? A hot body in my bed. Somebody I can count on. Good, consistent dick. Someone I can hold a conversation with, who makes me laugh. Consistently.”

“Those are definitely some pretty strong pros,” Toni laughed. “But okay, now what about the cons?”

I sighed. “I think… not being able to come and go as I please. Having to consider someone else's needs. The possibility of someone coming along and wanting to clip my wings.”

“Again, understandable,” Toni agreed. “But what if there was somebody who would give you the consistency you're looking for, without trying to stifle you?” After she said that, Toni tipped her head to the side. “Wait though,” she said. “I guess that might be kind of a unicorn, right?”

I pushed out another, deeper sigh. “Maybe so,” I said. “But then also maybe not. There is someone who kind of makes me wonder. Well… more than kind of, actually. He makes me wonder a lot.”

“Wow,” Toni exclaimed. “Are you serious right now? Jemma Love, captivated by someone.”

“Yeah,” I breathed. “Crazy, right?”

“Tell me about him,” she demanded. “Tell me everything.”

“There's really not a lot to tell that you don't already know. If you need a refresher, you could… just turn back to chapter five in my book.”

Toni's eyes went big. “You're seeing Mister Chapter Five?!”

“Well, seeing is not quite what I’d call what I've done a couple of times with Mister Chapter Five since the book released. I'm having a hard time not letting it become that though.”

“Why wouldn’t you — oh shit, never mind. you already told me that, Toni said. Okay so… what are you going to do? Are you going to let it become something, or are you going to keep running scared?”

“Wow. You too, Toni? Is everybody really just going to give me the business like this?”

“What should we do?” Toni asked. “Do you want me to lie to you?”

“No, of course not. It's just that…honestly, I really don't know what I'm going to do. I feel like I know what I should do, but I'm scared,” I admitted. “There it is, no denying it anymore. Jemma Love is scared to be serious with anyone, in case she falls in love and that nigga ruins her amazing life. Boom, there it is.”

Toni grinned. “Well, I'm certainly proud of you for putting it all out there, and being honest with yourself. And, might I say, that as someone who has definitely had her heart broken before, please know that I understand exactly how you feel. Honestly, it was part of why I started traveling too. To avoid settling in.”

“But you are settled in,” I reminded her. “Engaged and a mother settled in.”

“Yeah, when the right person happened along. Remember, I was engaged before Justin.”

I nodded. “Yeah I know, and that motherfucker was fine too.”

Toni laugh. “Yes, he was. But I had reservations. I knew he wasn't right for me. That wedding was never going to actually happen. But with Justin, once I got over our unfortunate pause in friendship, that is. It just feels right with him. But I was scared, and he did fuck up a bit at first. Yes, I did have some fear. But once I opened my mind to the possibility and decided to just let it be what it so clearly already was... I knew for sure. Justin was it.”

“So… what are you saying I should do?” I asked, completely enthralled by what she was telling me.

“I'm suggesting that you stop overthinking it. Give it a chance. If it doesn't work, it just doesn't work, and you move on. You let the chapter end.”

Hm.

I guess that didn't sound so bad.

I finished signing my stack of books and said my goodbyes to Toni in the back stockroom. I had a million things going through my mind as I headed back up to the front of the store, so many that I barely realized Levi was in the bookstore until I almost walked into him.

He was, unsurprisingly, browsing the art history section.

“So, she lives,” he quipped, looking good as hell in a simple tee and cargo shorts.

An obvious jab at my lack of response to the text message he’d sent me.

“I'm sorry,” I told him. “I swear, I wasn't ignoring your text. I just didn't know what to say to it.”

“You say yes, Jemma,” he prompted with a smile.

As if it was so easy.

“Right,” I nodded. “I say yes, we end up in bed, and you've gotten all you needed from me. A little ass and your next inspiration for your art.”

“That's what you think?” he asked, eyebrows raised.

“Is that not what this is? You were the one who set this precedent between us.”

“Am I?” He scoffed. “Or was that simply all you would agree to? I've maintained, since we reconnected, that I wanted to get to know you, Jemma. The possibility of being my muse was the only thing you responded to.”

“So why don't you tell me what this is then, Levi? Tell me what you're looking for from me. Tell me what this is about.”

“It's about me being willing to step outside of a self-imposed box to explore what could be between us, instead of letting it skirt past.”

“And what, exactly do you think this could be?” I asked

“Whatever we’d like it to be. Nothing we don't want it to be. Everything we do.”

I pushed my hair back over my shoulder, suddenly feeling a little bit overheated. “Here you go again,” I said. “Saying exactly what I want to hear.”

“Okay, now the question is, are you going to see it as game, or are you going to see it how I see it. As the intensity of our connection continuing to draw us together.”

I smiled and shook my head. “I don't know how I'm going to see it Levi. And I don't know what I'm going to do.”

“Would you like me to tell you?” He asked.

I was tired.

Not physically, but mentally and emotionally I was downright exhausted from trying to figure this out. I didn't want to consider things, or explore the possibilities, or weigh my options.

I wanted it to just be plain.

“Yes,” I told him. “I want you to tell me what to do.”

“Come to the Center opening next week,” he said.

“And what about right now?” I asked.

“Right now… you come home with me. And you stay until morning.”





Can you stop overthinking this for just two seconds?

I posed that question to myself as I stood on the other side of Levi's kitchen counter, watching him prepare a meal for the two of us. It was simple, supposedly, just a salad that would be topped with shrimp he was grilling at his stovetop right now. He claimed it was the only thing he knew how to make, but somehow, I felt like that wasn't true.

"I'm not sure if this is going to be up to standard for a palette as refined as yours," he teased turning to me with a smile. "I don't know if I can compete with your worldwide experience, as important as food seemed in your book."

I smiled over the fact that he'd actually read more than just the sexy parts, then replied, "Contrary to popular belief, I'm really not a picky eater. I enjoy good food, period. But it doesn't have to be fancy to be good."

"Well that makes me feel a lot better, because this is definitely not fancy," he said, taking the shrimp off the fire and washing his hands before moving back to the handmade remoulade dressing he'd been working on.

"I really think that your not fancy would defy a lot of people's definition of that," I said. "Whatever you're doing over there, it smells really amazing."

"Thank you. And thank you for giving me this time. I asked you over here on a whim, so I'm glad I had something in the fridge at all. Figured if I was interrupting your day, at least I could fix you lunch."

"I must say... you sure do know how to make a girl feel welcome."

"Do I?" he asked, turning to me with a raised eyebrow. "Cause I was starting to think you really didn't want anything to do with me. Starting to think I smelled bad or something."

I shook my head, laughing. "No, not that at all. Like I said… I'm just trying to figure myself out. The only reason I didn't answer that text was because I didn't know what to say."

"Yes, you said that," he reminded me. "And I thought I made it clear there was only one thing to say."

"We talked about this, Levi. I know you like to be on your Floetry, all you gotta do is say yes, but… just because you want something to be a certain way, doesn't make it so."

"But I don't believe that applies to this situation," he said. "To our situation. I understand that you're concerned about commitment, and I'm not trying to be the one who forces you into a situation where you're not going to be happy. But what I would like is for you to at least give it some consideration. With the understanding that I'm a very flexible man, Jemma. I'm not asking for you to stay here," he said, waving a hand to motion at his beautiful big house like it was a prison - showing me that he understood that's exactly what it would be for me. "I'm not trying to have you in this kitchen, barefoot and pregnant, none of that. That's just not where I am right now, and I know it's not where you are either. Maybe neither of us will ever want that."

"You are absolutely right," I nodded. "I don't want to feel smothered. I don't want to feel stifled. I don't want to feel handcuffed to any place, or to anyone."

He smirked. "Why do I feel like that sentence has a "but" that goes with it?"

"Because it does," I confirmed, grinning. "But, I don't quite know how to articulate it."

"So how about for now, we don't even try? Right now, it's not even important. We can talk about something else, while we eat. How about that?"

"Well, it depends on what you want to talk about."

"Anything," he answered. "Everything. Whatever your heart desires."

I thought about it for a second, then looked him in the face.

"What if I don't want to talk at all?" I asked. "What if I want to eat this salad and then have you take me up to your bedroom and make love to me until we pass out?"

Levi smiled. "Well, love... All you gotta do…"





Ten





Jemma



“If I die from this cuteness, promise you'll make sure I'm remembered well,” I told Joia as I held up my cellphone, pointing through the window of the NICU with my camera app. Teddy's big fine ass was in there, bare-chested, cradling a tiny, curly-haired baby TJ in his arms, getting in that ultra-important skin-to-skin time.

I was pretty sure it was the most adorable thing I’d ever seen, and I’d seen a lot of cute shit in my life.

“He is so insanely sweet with that baby,” Joia said, shaking her head as I put the camera down and shoved my cell back into my pocket. “I mean, I knew how he was going to be as a father, I could tell really easily. But seeing it in action? That is this whole other panty-wetting thing that inexplicably makes me want to give him three or four more. It’s a fucking setup, is what it is.”

I chuckled. “It is absolutely a setup.”

“Okay so anyway though,” Joia said, grabbing me by the arm and pulling me away from the waiting room. “As much as I love these two, I really need you to talk to me about anything except the NICU. What happened to you yesterday? I thought you were coming back up here.”

I pushed out a sigh, and shook my head. “Well, yeah I intended to. Right after I finished signing those books up at Tones&Tomes. But then… I ran into Levi again.”

“Again?” Joia asked. “Girl, will you finally just admit that this shit is fate?”

I groaned. “Oh my God, I am sick to death of that.” I huffed. “Yes, I realize it's fate. And it doesn't make the shit any less scary.”

Joia’s face dropped into a sympathetic grimace. “I'm sorry, for adding to the noise. But just give me a second here, okay?”

Honestly?

I’d give Joia a lot more than a second.

I loved the hell out of both of my sisters, but when it really came down to it, Joia was easily the most level-headed of the three of us - the one who wasn't really swayed by outside pressures to do something she didn't want to do.

Aspirational.

“I don't think you should do shit that you're scared of,” she started. “Well, let me rephrase that - I don't think that you should make any rushed decisions based on fear. My thing is, if it's meant to be, it's going to be. And his ass can wait for you to be ready to make a move. If it's really supposed to be, once you have time to mull and think over your decision, his ass will be right there,” she insisted. “It's really easy for me, for Jac, for mom, to have a whole lot to say about what you should do. “Stop playing girl, you know you want that man. Why don't you just do this? Why don't you do that?” Uh, because you're fucking scared! Nobody's trying to talk them into a room full of killer clowns or some shit like that, so guess what? You don't have to this shit either. My vote - even though, for the record, I do think Levi would be a good look for you - is for you to take every little bit of time you need to make a decision that works for you.”

“That's really how you feel?” I asked.

Joia nodded. “Girl, hell yes. We're both in the public eye, right? This social media thing has everybody who follows us - or not - feeling like they have some real input over our lives. But nobody but us has to actually live these lives, Jem. If it's supposed to be with Levi, it'll be. You know what I really think you should do?” She asked.

“Of course I want to know what you really think I should do,” I said.

“Instead of catching these feelings, you should catch a flight. Get away from all of this, and just go be Jemma. If Levi isn't waiting for you when you get back, oh well. The world has never had a shortage of niggas, and it’s not about to have one now. His loss.”

Hm.

I followed my little sister’s advice.

And by following her advice, I found myself on what was intended to be a week-long, mostly self-guided tour of Barcelona. Filled with delicious indulgence in Spanish food, loads of flirting with fine ass Spanish men, and plenty of time to think and reflect.

The conclusion I ended up coming to?

That I'd rather be back in Blakewood with my family.

And Levi.

My wistfulness wasn’t a sign that I needed to be back in Blackwood permanently by any means. But it definitely felt like this wasn't where I wanted to be right now.

That was supposed to be the beauty of this nomadic lifestyle, not feeling tied to any certain place for any certain time. But the other side of that was always having at least somewhere that felt like home.

Home was calling me.

And so was that nagging ass tether to Levi.

Even in all my flirting and exploring, in one of my favorite cities in the world, I still found my thoughts drawn back to him.

Which was maybe the point of Joia’s advice.

If nothing else, I felt like I’d made a good decision by coming on this trip, to give myself the reset I'd been trying to employ for a while. Still, I found myself on social media late in my room one night, scrolling for an inkling of what was happening in Levi’s life.

He hadn't called. Which was fine – neither had I.

He’d said he was going to let me make the decision for myself, and I appreciated the lack of pressure he tried to employ when I wasn't around him.

Levi wasn't super active on his social accounts, but there was one image that he’d posted just yesterday that immediately made me smile.

“Just a few more days…”, the caption read, under a picture of the nearly completed Marie Anders Art Center. I remembered him asking me to come to the opening, but my trip wasn't supposed to be over for several more days – past the date of the opening. Still… I navigated to my internet browser to purchase a flight.

If nothing else, I was a woman of my word.

In the meantime, I’d promised my Barcelona guide that I would accompany her to her friend's birthday party. Usually, I was the kind of girl that was always up for a party, but my energy was a little half-hearted as I did my hair and makeup, and put on a dress to go out.

But I did it, I’d promised, and Valencia was a wonderful guide. She’d shown me lots of little-known treasures about the city, and had helped cement my love for it.

Whoever her friend was, they must have had money because the party was taking place in a gorgeous Spanish hacienda style home. The stucco walls were covered in ivy and patina, decorated with tiny white string lights that made the whole thing really romantic and beautiful.

High-end liquor flowing, great music, and a whole lot of beautiful people showing a lot of glowing brown skin – this was exactly my vibe.

But tonight…I was just there.

That is, until the tiny hairs on my arms stood up with a sudden prickle of recognition.

My body was reacting to a familiar energy.

When I turned around… there was Levi.

It took my breath away.

He had to have noticed me before I noticed him, because when I turned, he was already staring in my direction. He looked good as usual, dressed in white linen that could have very, very easily have been really corny on anybody else.

On him, it was downright decadent.

He had a drink in his hand, and he raised it in my direction, a move that made me feel like he was tugging on some imaginary string that drew me closer to him.

“You know what this is, right?” he asked, as soon as I approached him.

“I do,” I nodded. “But don't say it.”

“I won't,” he agreed, giving me that sexy grin. “You look amazing.”

“You don't look so bad yourself. What are you doing here?”

He gestured around us. “The homeowner is an art collector, and a good friend of mine. It's his birthday, and I needed a little bit of a getaway to take a little bit of a breather before the center opens.”

“Ah,” I nodded. “That's probably wise. Well, I'll let you get back to the party. I just couldn't see you and not say hello.”

Levi grabbed my hand before I could move even an inch away, pulling me into his body. His eyes raked my face with animalistic intensity before his mouth broke into a smile. “Don't play with me, Jemma.” he said. “I was ready to get out of here, but something was holding me back. For some reason, I couldn't make myself leave. Now I see why.”

“So what exactly are you proposing?” I asked, breathless from the way he’d snatched me against him.

With his other hand, he took a sip of whatever was in his glass. “I'm proposing that we… recreate our time in Havana,” he said.

There was no need for a verbal response.

I just nodded, because I couldn't think of anything I wanted more.





Levi.





I wasn't remotely surprised when I woke up back in Blakewood without Jemma in my bed. I would have been more surprised if she had been there. I was, however, shocked to wake up in my little bungalow in Barcelona to find her still there.

Happily.

So I made the most of it.

And for the next two days, she and I did exactly what we'd done in Havana, and then we parted ways because I had to get back to Blakewood for the final preparations at the center. I didn't ask Jemma when she was coming back to Blakewood, didn't ask if she was planning to attend the opening, because in the grand scheme of things neither of those things mattered. Jemma was going to be where Jemma wanted to be, and I didn't want anything more than that from her.

But… I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me happy as hell when, at the center’s opening, I turned a corner to find Jemma standing there. In a dress seemingly designed to induce heart attacks, staring up at one of the pieces in the gallery.

I tried my best not to get distracted from the people I was talking to - the mayor of the city and a couple of other people from his entourage. I forced myself to stay engaged with the conversation, to graciously accept their congratulations and thanks about opening the center, and their pledge of city resources to keep it going. Those things were amazing, and I was grateful. This building was packed with people who were all interested in what was happening here, people who were interested in supporting the vision, and supporting me.

But all I wanted to do was get to Jemma.

When I managed to get away, Jemma was still in the same place, fascinated by the particular piece she was looking at. I walked up to her, placing a hand at the small of her back, and it was so, so gratifying that rather than move away or look surprised, she melted into my touch.

“Unfathomable Connections,” she said, reading the name of the piece - one of the largest here in the gallery. “Artists, Levi Anders… and Jemma Love.” She looked at me with this mischievous glint in her eyes. “This is a rather bold move, Mr. Anders. You have a little naughty streak in you.”

“I didn't make this by myself, Jemma,” I told her, turning my gaze up to observe the canvas too. “I seem to recall having some very eager assistance.”

Indeed, I had not made this by myself, and to the casual observer it had to just look like an abstract piece.

But she and I knew what it was about.

“So you made it,” I continued. “To the opening, I mean.”

She turned to me, looking up to meet my eyes. “I told you I would.”

“Yes, but I also haven't heard from you since Barcelona… so I'm sure you can understand it if I wasn't quite sure what my place was with you.”

“Well, that would make two of us,” she admitted. “All I know is, I like being around you.”

“Okay. So let me propose this: Whenever in Blakewood, you consider my home open to you. Whether I'm there or not. I have that big empty house, plenty of room. We wouldn't even have to see each other if we didn’t want to.”

At first, her face was relatively expressionless, but it quickly became clear that she was trying to suppress a smile. Eventually it became impossible, and she had to let it break free, but quickly tempered it into a close-mouthed grin.

“Okay. That is a very attractive offer… And I think I'll accept that.”

“Terrific,” I told her, happily.

Was it a little intense?

Yeah, it was.

But it also felt right, and there was no downplaying how much her acceptance pleased me.

“Can I make a counter-offer?” She asked, tipping her head to the side. “Well, not really a counter-offer, I guess. More like… something that would sweeten the pot.”

“Absolutely.” I pushed my hands into the pockets of my slacks, giving her my full attention. Not that she didn't already have it, but I was even more interested now.

“Well, it was quite nice to see you in Barcelona. And… I was thinking… maybe… what if I shared my travel schedule with you? And if you happened to be in the same place I was, we could spend a few days getting reacquainted. I… wouldn't hate that. I’d actually like it very much. I mean, when our schedules aligned of course. If you wanted to. I wouldn’t expect you to—”

Before she could finish overthinking something I thought would be a perfect compromise and alignment of our values, I pulled my hands from my pockets to grab either side of her face and pulled her in for a kiss, something I'd wanted to do since I walked up to her.

She melted right into that too.

A few seconds later, I heard an unsurprising chorus of wolf whistles and other encouragement of our public display of affection.

Shit.

I've gotten a little too wrapped up in the moment, and hadn't considered the fact that we were in an extremely public place, with all kinds of press and other people there, including members of both of our families. This moment was probably being uploaded to social media right as we stood there.

Jemma didn’t seem to care though.

She laughed, then pressed herself up to plant another soft kiss against my lips. “This is your night,” she reminded me. “You have interviews and stuff to give.”

I nodded, knowing she was right. “Will you be here?” I asked, not giving a single fuck if it sounded thirsty. Because… hell, it was. And Jemma Love was my refreshingly sensual, limited edition drink of choice.

She gave me the kind of smile that heated me from the inside out and nodded. “Right now… I don’t want to be anywhere else.”



The end.





Epilogue





~ two years later ~





Jaclyn





"What exactly is the purpose of this again?" Kadan asked, from his shirtless position beside Kenzo. They were both holding today's main attractions - a kitten in one hand, a cup of ice cream in the other.

"Squint a little more," I demanded, ignoring his objections to my obvious objectification. I got their fine asses perfectly framed in the shot and then snapped it with my camera phone. "Perfect," I declared, then immediately navigated to the appropriate apps to upload the image to both the pet clinic and Dreamery social media pages.

Today was a big day.

The vet clinic parking lot was teeming with people, and I was confident that my impromptu marketing just now would attract even more. Visitors were here from all over the state for the pet adoption drive the clinic was co-hosting, featuring hopeful animals from nearly every shelter in a hundred-mile radius of Blakewood. While they looked at pets - and hopefully started the paperwork to take one home - they were treated to ice cream from one of the many mobile carts sponsored by Dreamery.

There were other sponsors from local businesses nearby, but mostly, this was a joint venture put on by Kadan and me.

Coochies & Cream.

It had taken a little convincing to get him on board with the name, but now it was on all the banners, flyers, and whatever else I'd been able to slap it on, because it was perfect.

"What are you going to tell people when they see that picture and come up here asking where the hoes at?" Kadan asked, pulling his Blakewood Animal Clinic tee shirt back over his head.

"I'm gonna point them in your direction, duh," I teased, smacking him on the ass. "How many adoptions were we at, at last count?"

"My last count before you turned this into Magic Mike was sixteen."

I grinned. "See? And you thought it wasn't going to work."

"I never thought the adoption drive wasn't going to work," he countered, following me into the cool, air-conditioned comfort of the clinic. "I thought the sexual innuendo would stop people from bringing their kids."

I sucked my teeth. "Fuck them kids," I laughed. "But you see they're out there anyway, don't you?"

"I do." He pulled the clipboard I was holding from my hands and put it on the counter, out of the way so he could draw me into his arms. "I shouldn't have doubted you, Ms. Love."

"Damn right." I puckered my lips for a kiss and he obliged, shamelessly pulling me into a full-bodied make out that was much deeper than the quick peck I expected.

When we pulled back, he met my gaze with full-blown lust that had me ready to forget we had a lot full of people outside. Instead of giving in to it though, I gave him a teasing grin as I pulled away, holding up my hand.

"How would you feel if I kept my last name?" I asked, wiggling my fingers so that the engagement ring he'd put there just last week could catch the light. "I don't know if Mrs. Davenport is going to have the same… je ne sais quoi as Love."

Kadan chuckled. "Woman, long as you coucher avec moi ce soir or whatever the fuck Patti said, I'll call you whatever you want."

My eyes went wide. "Don't tell me Judge Auntie was a disco fan?"

"Had Patti and her sisters in my ear every damn Saturday morning," Kadan confirmed, grabbing my hand to pull me back toward him. "As consistently as I'm trying to be in your guts, even after you're Mrs.… DickyMcStrangerballs."

I cackled laughing at that, but that was quickly stifled by his lips on mine again, and I melted into my future husband.

"We gotta get back out there," he said, even though his hands were gripping my ass in a way that didn't inspire me to go back outside.

Still, I knew he was right.

As if she knew too, Ms. Thing came from wherever she'd been hiding in the back, meowing and making the usual noise. She went straight to the window, putting her paw against the glass, and I followed the direction she was looking until I saw something that made me smile.

"Her friend is here," I told Kadan, grabbing his hand to pull him toward the door. "Come on."



Joia





"Look who it is, TJ! Look!"

I couldn't help the big smile on my face over TJs reaction to the sight of Ms. Thing in Jaclyn's arms. I didn't know what it was between my baby and that damn cat, but they had the most epic of friendships going on.

TJ - Theodore James, not junior - wiggled his way out of Teddy's arms, and Ms. Thing did the same with Jaclyn, allowing the two of them to run together like they were star-crossed lovers in some emo romance novel.

Teddy threw up his hands in defeat while we watched TJ - usually a wrecking ball of energy - interact ever-so-gently with the cat, using his budding vocabulary to tell her about… trains, I think.

I reached up, circling my hand against Teddy's back. "It's okay baby," I soothed him, teasingly. Whenever TJ got around animals - especially Ms. Thing - he tended to forget we existed.

Teddy shrugged it off, turning to me with a grin. "It's fine. The boy is just developing an early appreciation for pus—"

"Can you not?" I interrupted, and Teddy pursed his lips, nodding.

"I can, indeed, not," he agreed. "I knew it wasn't right when it was coming out of my mouth, but it's like I couldn't stop it, you know?"

"What are y'all whispering about over here?" Jaclyn asked, suddenly a lot closer than she'd been a few seconds ago. When I glanced around her, TJ was in Kadan's arms, and Ms. Thing was perched on his shoulder, something that seemed to greatly amuse my baby.

"Trying to peep this ice cream," Teddy told her, rubbing his hands together. "I heard you were the plug."

Jaclyn's head dropped, playing along. "Yeah nigga, I got that lemon verbena, brown sugar apricot, tiramisu, got it in scoops, pints, quarts. I own this block and listen - we got whatever you need."

We laughed at her antics, and then on a slightly more serious note she sent us off to explore, assuring us that she and Kadan could handle TJ.

I didn't have to be told twice - I grabbed Teddy's hand, and we went the other way, where the vendor stands were all set up.

"You know you should be out here with them, right?" Teddy asked in my ear, his hand perched at the small of my back as we walked down the line.

"Don't start…," I warned.

"I'm just saying, baby - Joia's Joyous Jambalayas should be out here represented."

Any annoyance I felt about him bringing up this topic was instantly erased by today's ridiculous name suggestion. I'd made the mistake of telling him I wanted to - with my brand-new nutrition certification - officially get into the meal planning and preparation business, based on the hundreds of people I'd helped with their diet. It was a good idea, especially in the face of so many people with any real credentials scamming people with harmful, unsustainable pipe dreams that left them worse off than they started.

Why was it a mistake?

Well, because mentioning it to Teddy meant he was going to hold me to it.

"You don't like that one?" he asked, pulling me into him with a grin. "I'm gonna stop suggesting shit to you. I should've stopped after you pretended "Don't Eat THAT Shit. Eat THIS Shit." Wasn't absolute flames."

"DETSETS was easily the worst," I giggled. "I was pretty partial to Real Meal Plan Shit myself."

"Okay so why aren't we out here with a booth, blasting some Stallion, some Vanity. Or y'all don't do Hot Girl Summers no more?"

Instantly, I scowled at him. "Don't even mention that to me - need I remind you this is the second summer body you'll have ruined for me, in the past three years? Not to mention last summer, when I was marrying your ass. I haven't had a Hot Girl Summer since I let you hit again."

My ugly expression didn't last long in the face of Teddy's grin - he was way too thrilled about the course of things between us.

TJ.

A summer wedding almost a year ago.

And now… another positive pregnancy test.

Not live streamed this time.

This time, I was well versed enough with the symptoms that I'd immediately known something was up. Sure enough, I'd presented a positive pregnancy test to my husband this morning.

"Sexy Spring Equinox?" Teddy suggested, grinning. "Cause I don't think you're gonna make winter solstice."

"You make me so damn sick, “I laughed, shaking my head as I pulled my ringing cell phone from the pocket of my jeans.

"My baby is doing that, actually, Teddy quipped, and I flipped him off as I answered the call from Jemma.

"Hey big head. What's going on?"



Jemma





"Hey big head. What's going on?"

I grinned at Levi as he stepped back into the room, right when Joia answered the phone. He was in nothing but boxer briefs, carrying a tray that held what I recognized as mimosas and omelets. I had to look away from him, so I could focus on call I'd made.

"Where are you?" I asked her. "You at Jac's thing yet?"

"We just got here, maybe ten minutes ago. You're still coming right?"

"Absolutely. I was about to get ready to head out now, but umm… Something just came up, so I might be a little while."

Joia giggled. "Mmmhm. Something came up. You and Levi don't make any babies."

"My IUD is locked and loaded, believe me," I quipped back, my gaze turning back to Levi as he sat the tray down and climbed into the bed with me.

"Clink clink!" Joia teased, and then we got off the phone so I could give my attention to Levi, who I hadn't seen in several weeks.

"I thought I was quiet when I came in," I told him, accepting his lips as he leaned in toward me.

He nipped my bottom lip with his teeth, then soothed it with his tongue. "You were. I didn't know you were here until this morning. Felt you when I woke up."

"And decided to bring breakfast in bed. Aren't you a gentleman," I mused, picking up my mimosa and taking a drink to cover the fact that his "felt you this morning" thing was… sexy as hell.

He didn't mean physically - he'd slept in the master bedroom, while I'd taken the guest room we'd, without needing to discuss it, designated as mine.

He meant intuitively.

"Well, you took great care of me in more ways than one in Lagos last month," he growled into my ear, then sat back to pick up his own glass. "This is a small way to return the favor."

I laughed. "I enjoyed Lagos just as much as you did, trust me." I picked up my plate. "What do you have going on today?"

"Nothing too heavy. I'm due at Coochies and Cream in about an hour. I donated two hours of quick portraits of people with their new pets."

I nodded. "So you're already going anyway. I was going to ask if you wanted to come with me."

Levi's eyebrows shot up, and he choked a bit on the forkful of omelet he'd just put in his mouth. "You were going to let me be seen with you?" he asked. "Is it already a new quarter?"

"Oh shut up," I laughed. "I'm not that bad, am I?"

Levi grinned. "You're not, I'm only teasing you, love. I did think you were going to throw blows in Curacao though, with that woman who wouldn't stop taking pictures of us."

Ugh.

My nose turned up at just the memory of it.

Even though sex with Levi was amazing, and we got in plenty of it, we did enjoy other things as well. There - for us, at least - had to be more to having a "traveling bae" than just sex in exotic locations.

I wanted to make out in public in exotic locations too.

Obviously, we weren't just making out - we were exploring the world together, finding each other at least once a month at this point. And the last thing I wanted, after not having seen him for weeks, was some nosy chick with her cell phone pointed at us long enough to shoot a feature fucking film.

Obviously, I was still annoyed about it.

But that didn't stop me from wanting to do things with Levi, embracing the evolution of our relationship as it happened.

I kept getting asked to write a book about it.

I wasn't sure about that, since I barely believed this arrangement was actually working for me, and couldn't dare recommend it for someone else, as if I were an expert. For now, I was just focused on enjoying the happiness I'd carved out of this life.

"You're gonna make me lose my appetite," I threatened.

He shook his head. "Well we definitely don't want that. I worked hard on these omelets."

"Exactly," I nodded. "So let's eat. And then you can paint me like one of your French girls."

Levi laughed. "Yes, let's eat. And then I'm definitely gonna do something to you. But painting wasn't what I had in mind."
