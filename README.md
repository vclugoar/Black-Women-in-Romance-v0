# Black Women in Romance Recommender (v0) 

As a capstone project I built a pythob-based app that recommends Romance novels written by Black women, as a way to increase visibility to both the Romance genre and Black women authors. 

This is v0 of the project, main differentiator from other (future) versions is the data collection process and the scope.
