For Nesto Vasquez, moving his Afro-Caribbean food truck from New York City to the wilds of Upstate New York is a huge gamble. If it works? He'll be a big fish in a little pond. If it doesn't? He'll have to give up the hustle and return to the day job he hates. He's got six months to make it happen--the last thing he needs is a distraction.

Jude Fuller is proud of the life he's built on the banks of Cayuga Lake. He has a job he loves and good friends. It's safe. It's quiet. And it's damn lonely. Until he tries Ithaca's most-talked-about new lunch spot and works up the courage to flirt with the handsome owner. Soon he can't get enough--of Nesto's food or of Nesto. For the first time in his life, Jude can finally taste the kind of happiness that's always been just out of reach.

An opportunity too good to pass up could mean a way to stay together and an incredible future for them both... if Nesto can remember happiness isn't always measured by business success. And if Jude can overcome his past and trust his man will never let him down.",https://www.amazon.com/American-Dreamer-Dreamers-Adriana-Herrera/dp/1335006877,American dreamer,221

Haitian-born professor and activist Patrice Denis is not here for anything that will veer him off the path he's worked so hard for. One particularly dangerous distraction: Easton Archer, the assistant district attorney who last summer gave Patrice some of the most intense nights of his life, and still makes him all but forget they're from two completely different worlds.

All-around golden boy Easton forged his own path to success, choosing public service over the comforts of his family's wealth. With local law enforcement unfairly targeting young men of color, and his career--and conscience--on the line, now is hardly the time to be thirsting after Patrice again. Even if their nights together have turned into so much more.

For the first time, Patrice is tempted to open up and embrace the happiness he's always denied himself. But as tensions between the community and the sheriff's office grow by the day, Easton's personal and professional lives collide. And when the issue at hand hits closer to home than either could imagine, they'll have to work to forge a path forward... together.",https://www.amazon.com/American-Love-Story-Dreamers-Book-ebook/dp/B07S8HH7LK/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Adriana+Herrera+American+love+story&qid=1615933508&s=books&sr=1-1,American love story ,222

Except when it comes to Priscilla, the childhood friend he's loved for what seems like forever.

New York City police detective Priscilla Gutierrez has never been afraid to go after what she wants. Second guessing herself isn't a thing she does. But lately, the once-clear vision she had for herself--her career, her relationships, her life--is no longer what she wants.

What she especially doesn't want is to be stuck on a private jet to the Dominican Republic with JuanPa, the one person who knows her better than anyone else.

By the end of a single week in paradise, the love/hate thing JuanPa and Pris have been doing for sixteen years has risen to epic proportions. No one can argue their connection is still there.

When an unavoidable work obligation lands him there for twelve weeks, he may finally have a chance for the closure he so desperately needs. What Desta never expected was to catch a glimpse of his future as he reconnects with the beautiful country and his family's past.

Elias Fikru has never met an opportunity he hasn't seized. Except, of course, for the life-changing one, he's stubbornly ignored for the past nine months. He'd be a fool not to accept the chance to pursue his doctoral studies in the U.S., but saying yes means leaving his homeland, and Elias isn't ready to make that commitment.

Meeting Desta, the Dominican-American emergency relief worker with the easy smile and sad eyes, makes Elias want things he's never envisioned for himself.

Delaney Westmoreland is ready for some peace of mind after graduating from medical school. After eight years of nonstop studying, she's more than earned a month at her cousin's secluded, luxurious cabin. Unfortunately, it's already occupied! The good news: the stranger is drop-dead gorgeous. The bad news: all he wants is to put her luggage back in the car so she can leave immediately.

Not going to happen.

Jamal Ari Yassir had just settled into his friend's cabin when spitfire Delaney drove up. When he demands she leave, she simply picks up her luggage and moves into one of the spare bedrooms. Given how absolutely gorgeous she is, avoiding temptation will be sheer hell... and it's not long before he gives in. But when their month together draws to a close, what's a sheikh to do when his short-term fling has become so much more?

But a live tweet of a horrific date just revealed the painful truth: she's been catfished by a three-timing jerk of a boyfriend. Suddenly Samiah -- along with his two other 'girlfriends,' London and Taylor -- have gone viral online. Now the three new besties are making a pact to spend the next six months investing in themselves. No men and no dating. For once Samiah is putting herself first, and that includes finally developing the app she's always dreamed of creating. Which is the exact moment she meets the deliciously sexy Daniel Collins at work. What are the chances?

Never one to shy away from a challenge, Mack now has her sights set on an even bigger prize: the mayor's office. But only when the time is right. And only if she can get the pesky freelance journalist hell-bent on investigating her for corruption--who just so happens to be one of the sexiest men alive and her best friend's younger brother--off her back. But when Mack suspects that her longtime mentor and the city's current mayor is up to no good, she must convince Ezra Holmes to help her investigate the mayor's office.

Ezra can admit to having had a thing for Mackenna in his younger days, even though she barely knew his name back then. But his past feelings for Mack have nothing to do with why he's so committed to exposing her. He suspects she's used her influence as a public official to cut private deals, and breaking this corruption story would be just the thing to jumpstart his fading career. But what is Ezra supposed to do when he discovers Mack isn't the one who's a crooked politician? There's only one thing he can do: join forces with the woman he's been crazy about for far too long.",https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Holmes-Brothers-Book-ebook/dp/B071Z52RSC/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Farrah+Rochon+Trust+Me&qid=1615951229&s=digital-text&sr=1-3,Trust me,215

The unquenchable heat that followed stirred his soul, sending his heart on a quest he himself hadn't agreed to venture on. As a friendship between the two flourishes, and they're cloaked in a dynamic surge of desire, Raphael is met with the ultimate challenge: surrender to a second chance at love or abandon his happily ever after for a lifetime.",https://www.amazon.com/Your-Permission-Heart-Valentine-Book-ebook/dp/B07MWH6HFJ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=With+Your+Permission&qid=1615771039&s=books&sr=1-1,With your permission,339
